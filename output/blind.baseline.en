yes , good day my ladies , my gentlemen .
it 's very much for the invitation here today to talk .
and i have to me , right now , which present .
my name is christian <unk> and i am , some weird term , <unk> at the city food .
that 's called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> 's first one : computing , and second organization , three , the public policy .
so i 'm for the <unk> this city in charge .
and well as you do not to popular .
i know .
and beyond , and this is something which my son particularly like , i 'm also <unk> .
that means i 'm the head of <unk> firemen .
<unk> <unk> and five hundred <unk> .
and so , i 'm thinking about , is obviously a subject matter , with the today i <unk> want .
which is with the theme of <unk> , because also that 's the firemen .
we hope to the best and we get us on the worst ago , that 's what jack that once said .
you know him .
he was once in general <unk> .
and then i start something not so serious to say .
i <unk> you a position .
how we talk , if it sort of a risk is , we just before a disaster stand for example , <unk> <unk> , rush hour .
many people are traveling .
it pushing up , it <unk> to .
and somewhere on the is a suitcase , lonely , leaving , something <unk> , maybe military towers with signs .
nobody seems to to belong .
the suitcase can hear nothing .
suddenly an announcement .
leave you that <unk> .
police comes , fire department , <unk> .
people are .
officials <unk> .
they go out .
what 's because this ? , asking <unk> .
we know that also not or we ca n't it says .
the people leave the building .
children cry .
some fall even maybe , because it all very quickly go to .
suddenly a gossip .
there 's <unk> in .
a panic breaks out .
i am now here on .
the rest leave me your imagination .
but it 's no fantasy , that i <unk> have . <unk> ?
this is what , in this week is happening in <unk> .
there 's such a suitcase can be them .
later turned out , that only in , <unk> , nine pounds of drugs at it was .
but people were just like , and that has a friend me that tells , from the building forced into .
it did n't say .
and there was that same rumor suddenly at least in the group on , the my friend in the my friend and ended up .
thank god is n't panic <unk> , otherwise would all the long not as benign out how it appears .
you see , in a <unk> , in a <unk> disaster is communication a very important thing well .
communication is so important , because people in this situation where people to communicate <unk> .
they want to know what 's because there .
once in the good old was time that for the authorities , pretty simple .
we just have n't told or we 've got lied .
why ?
because the so-called <unk> there .
you have to this fair to say , god , the people get in panic , there saying we 'd better not the truth or we say the <unk> .
this is in a time of social media , in a time of twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time of private and public satellite broadcasters , in a time of <unk> and public television not possible .
simple and emotional and because it all , not on is and second is mostly anyway we the past as a force , the about what happened on .
they may remember , at the passenger in the hudson river , before that 's a year , ago .
the first <unk> about it came on twitter .
of someone , the on a ferry was and simply and emotional immediately <unk> , this is an airplane <unk> and we save the people now .
it was not <unk> .
you see , we 're looking dependent on today , simple and emotional of first the truth to say , and very <unk> to inform .
because usually we 're obviously also the past , the supposedly the truth know , because we as a force to going to pay attention , we just <unk> information pass .
it 's public media right , private media either not so much thought , or you just do n't either .
of so , we 're going into food , and that 's also something that , even by media gone are , we think about how we in the future with <unk> them .
and that we 'll be the good old <unk> back out .
however , just as a form of <unk> .
that means we 're in the next few years about a hundred <unk> in the <unk> build , the , some of you know that , <unk> , if it just for <unk> coming .
once it was that .
you may know they still do , three times in short , once in short , again , and even just means .
i do n't know anymore .
we 're going to this today have increasingly with all <unk> , on the place this have , so <unk> about , facebook , on twitter , about the radio <unk> also at night , about the television and after all over the internet and the local media and so forth and immediately , connected of course , with <unk> , and ultimately the information to continue to get .
and we know , we 've got there very quickly and <unk> operate and we 've got there very quickly and <unk> inform , because the empower and citizens to be otherwise <unk> .
and we ultimately , not more that believe what we tell you want .
communication in the recession or in the disaster is so one a question of speed of all media , that we apply to stand , and it 's also a question of its credibility .
its credibility is our biggest problem , because the empower and citizens to say either , oh , the little time again , is all not , or they say , the <unk> us , it 's all much worse than it in fact is .
we have therefore , too bad experiences done with facebook and twitter , more recently , .
and that you may have some of in them the media taken from .
we have a bigger <unk> in food <unk> wished .
and it 's a so-called chemical bomb .
this is that bombs , the with a <unk> an are , because the supposed to and once not the first <unk> on the <unk> explode , it by the houses in the second world war <unk> and just at the floor by a chemical response , the mechanisms going , that , a metal sheet , the <unk> <unk> two <unk> of each other so , the to <unk> , and then it came to blast .
the problem is just , many of bombs 've never works and are , like , in <unk> one of the in food <unk> .
and where we were from an older and mr. , be the extent , he 's so beautiful in the protocol said , chiefly wanted , we were now , he had seen as you <unk> forty-three somebody 's right , and <unk> he 's the authorities about now , that there a bomb it . left the background
incidentally , since then have a couple of older gentlemen play around the <unk> .
we 'll see what we still find everything .
and bombs to immediately in place , not <unk> be , but <unk> to .
and so we then in <unk> park simple and emotional one , in every sense of the word , a bomb <unk> let .
and first time in history of the city all the conversations on facebook and twitter running , let with the consequence , that the entire <unk> far over <unk> <unk> up on are .
and the media was thrilled . left the background .
we had n't even with which telephony , but that have <unk> and <unk> , all over <unk> and twitter .
all that had a great effect for us , because the credibility will <unk> increased about these social media .
just so , they 've got me also a sign give you , i quit ; .
i can of this is not on the clock check .
this is the credibility and so , because all , these social media for the have , that you very much information pass .
not so much <unk> are , because the members that there are tweeting right the <unk> , you calls them , a high <unk> have .
secondly , fast amending .
if anything not true , writes that , who immediately , so the credibility , of the i just 've talked about , significantly increase , because you saw the whole community in principle of the reports in is .
and it 's a very high <unk> therefore , so if anything wrong is , then it can also very quickly and you correct to .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> , the the fun to found , as a bomb in <unk> park up about .
of and so we from all the things that in the last years happened is , and there are much more <unk> happens when <unk> a still think , as <unk> one knows .
also the city of food can every day of such a disaster home for to .
a bomb , the in <unk> to be in a park , is certainly not such a .
but you can also , and even after that <unk> we 're now , in <unk> be found and then here we there with our <unk> try and the in seven meters deep <unk> .
and if the , think of munich , think of other cities , if the then <unk> to be , because it 's called a <unk> has , the you conventional n't defuse can , then we know already now , be a variety of houses and n't like that look like before .
and that to communicate is important , one because it just in one in a world <unk> <unk> rate is necessary , communication to do , in 's also out to stop , in order to worry about to carry , that people what are , in order to worry about to carry , that people in the are able to , and on these difficult situation work .
and the social media help us , and , believable to be , because ultimately you all of the communication 're involved in , and it 's not just a one-page <unk> is how we this in the <unk> , <unk> and certainly , even in the <unk> for much of had .
of so today is <unk> not just a task of the authorities , not just a task of firemen , or the <unk> , of <unk> , the <unk> , red cross etc. slope , but communication in the catastrophe and way of a catastrophe about us to all of .
and <unk> this has shown .
there 's about twitter and about how a great deal of aid gone , if also partially you still so overwhelmed with was because suddenly <unk> of people any <unk> build wanted and you did n't even more where the <unk> are .
that shows , there 's much more to do , also for public communication in <unk> , but the unprecedented solidarity with the <unk> and the <unk> has just shown that the social media from a <unk> , from a communication did n't even more way to think are .
and i hope that i you a little of 've convinced , that this medium , that itâ€™s actually for the beautiful things of life often is used , even in <unk> its meaning and purpose is fulfilling and that we as a town that for the for the <unk> in charge is , this instrument in the future , still really new and very different out 're going to her , to the citizens to use of empower and citizens and to end , i and <unk> me , very much for listening as if i they all the time n't have seen .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> different .
i 'm writer and <unk> , as you just been about .
and i 'm right now , still there , a own <unk> to form .
what it is that there i <unk> make me , that i 'll give you also in a moment ago .
before i do that , i must but a few things <unk> .
the first is , , i think that we stories really to life needed .
that we no stories do n't could live .
moreover , i believe that it 's very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories are , as of the entertainment business actually produced to .
then i think there , that the internet , the infinite possibility is , of fact that well as anybody <unk> really properly <unk> will .
and four i 'm <unk> of that convinced that people that were created , to be creative .
and that they 're happier are , once you be creative get to .
the more people 're happy , as better it 's the world .
very logical .
these better world is now , just a byproduct .
in the first time i am , as i said , a storyteller .
and the story that i tell me , starting to midnight in a bar , in the just happy <unk> group will .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .

it something happens in your mind , in your body , with your perception .
and they did n't actually word for it .
they do n't know , which there right now .
i 've now words that .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see on the one side <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and it 's a black and white .
i did , feel that i 'm sort of <unk> .
<unk> .
and on the other hand we have the two then the trap oz with a very much color .
and it was at this spot once told that i better <unk> and writing , when that i draw .
so , the first , which <unk> now with your new perceptions see is an alien man with <unk> <unk> hair , the front of her is , you very serious look at and says , very congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> about it on , it to a very special kind of people heard .
she was as <unk> born .
players are people that off your <unk> age to your lifetime play have to .
who of you know <unk> ?
very beautiful .
now , ago , the <unk> at <unk> n't <unk> , if you stack them make , but <unk> from the pocket .
so cube , <unk> , <unk> , anything possible .
what really important is , the players have no insight into on their <unk> .
we know , as not , when we die .
i wish that every a long life but we know it 's just not .
it could tomorrow also all been passed his .
and so it 's in my players , so .
they do n't even in , how much you because actually play .
that means , again , every lost minute could the last could be .
a player , of his entire lifetime what has , <unk> in the moment of <unk> like a candle , the <unk> will .
now you can of course , another , if it 's because that is dangerous , why are playing the then place ?
the answer is clearly , this .
without play , without player for a around , <unk> all , gray and only when a player does , he 's actually alive .
that were to play there .
so .
this story of <unk> and you now the world of gamers <unk> , and your first challenge is and of course , inevitably in <unk> in love , this is the story that i tell me .
and it in form of a <unk> .
the first season has 12 follow , sorry , i 'm here is a <unk> happens that i just too late to have seen .
so , twelve follow in the first season with a length of each one five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a consequence for the other , beautiful <unk> told , that you know it .
that television is doing for his <unk> nothing else .
this is not news .
and if it all be , then if only ' i now one is done .
and also do n't actually here .
now it goes but just right off .
we go one more time to <unk> back .
what 's the most famous set out of the movie or from the series ?
it can only a give , right .
thanks .
as if we practiced that would have .
and so that 's true in my players which is not to .
of which can it 's quite a lot of giving .
it 's so many different games .
just think about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so forth and so forth .
and just as <unk> 's also the number of gamers .
and so be here a lot of stories that all told you want to be .
now would be the next question : who 's that because it all share ?
i did , already quite a high view of me .
i believe me for sufficient smart and the most creative .
but i know that a hundred brain longer producing as only one , even if it 's mine is .
so it came right to the idea that you the crowd , in the creative process <unk> .
, what if we <unk> not only <unk> or allow , but even <unk> ?

and imagine , for instance , in the result three , a <unk> on that you really neat find , because he you for example of her grandfather of .
they also a big fan of <unk> .
then you can now easy with the modern technology is that i did n't like that hard , a <unk> do .
and this store them on the <unk> up , where it then straight , and this is that really cool <unk> , the really interested audience <unk> will .
this is , it 's not anywhere among , but it lands right right there , where it up to .
it really nice thing is that we the internet is .
and the web , you can itâ€™s really do anything .
so , every medium is kind of allowing .
that means you as viewers you can write , drawing , spinning , which also the do you want .
and if we have now , again this structure look at .
this looks <unk> bit of <unk> net , right ?
so this <unk> , what common set up going .
and i 'm really <unk> of that convinced that the internet was born in , exactly this kind of stories to tell .
do it just unfortunately , not so many , more specifically about none .
so now this saying , i but even still a step further and in the viewer for ourselves to the players are .
which is in a <unk> .
there you can against the characters from the show them but also against people in the concrete environments , that also this <unk> on your phone have .
<unk> thing here , that you know it may also all very very well , is something like this mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> entertainment .
these amazing , which that they 're very rapidly evolve .
and on the i do n't go into can , because i think back 20 minutes would need .
we take root again , together .
everybody 's time on this is made of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> and then we have the <unk> .

that i have the first prize for the best <unk> been .
and i have to say , these jury was all of officials from banks , of the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so reasonable people , you should think .
and when i the convince can , here with my : the internet right use , narrative structures revolutionize , incidentally , even better world , then i think , i can actually every persuade .
so .
everybody 's time off , why does that all because now this ?
because it alone in this names all areas covered to .
we have of course , once the <unk> , who 's view , i 'm up , you 're off , everybody 's time on this .
now , then that die .
in the series is very very much died .
everybody 's time it means , everyone to even die .
and then , as well , everybody 's time off in terms of everyone can be part , when he that would like .
this is i really important .
i come , from the <unk> and there 's nothing worse in my opinion to , as if it 's a <unk> will .
i do n't know , if you seen that .
if you in theater , and then comes the actor so in the auditorium and all this : oh god , please now not me .
and this is it 's not .
so it 's volunteer interaction .
and nobody has to .
he can also just only people just be .
the reason i german speaking is the , that the entire project , in german will be , once .
that has also a few reasons .
i 'm with this project <unk> some time traveling and i was always then wondered : go all the but in english , demographic bigger , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i can just say , the german <unk> is the third largest the world .
the <unk> is the english , it comes the spanish , and then the german .
now it 's so not so , when we 'd us in some small when move .
and also really believe actually really , if it also other people like this is like me that the people be grateful to be for something that not by any <unk> <unk> was , where the end then everybody <unk> and every pun <unk> 's been .
if that everything that 's , i do it would have , it 's the first a result now on the first twelfth-century alchemist <unk> online .
and if you to go asking why i because i 'm here at a <unk> , where it 's below the <unk> <unk> fort worth <unk> 's going .
and to have i 'm also a couple of done .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also pretty sensitive of <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were also , and <unk> .
and i can really just say that this all know incredibly important is and incredibly <unk> .
but it uses , everything nothing , if you 's not apply .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just let 's all taken have , what i like 've learned .
and it applied was .
and so far is it 's good .
i can really just say .
so if , so anybody thinks , i want to have been my part up , i had degrees ' one idea <unk> character or i did , ai drawing <unk> cartoon , or what also the , that 's also already now .
you find ourselves , for the web .
on facebook .
well , as free the speakers were talking about .
yes , <unk> ' i also .
welcome welcome to , you can memories are ?
question , to you
you can memories are ?
you can , because at all remember what in your life ever story ?
have still <unk> in mind ?
who has who can be even at all remember ?
it 's no hands up .
so you 're memories are ?
apparently been .
thank you .
no , just like we want it 's now not doing .
and then they would be the talk to be pretty quickly .
another good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk today night , the i did i chose , because he two of my passions , or my two great love down at interface .
i did ' , here in near the <unk> studied and got ' i just with the bits and bytes busy , the today , so tall by the world fly .
and <unk> some time i 'm also now as a coach , consultants in private and professional a way .
on the one hand , i 'm so with the with the computer very much too , on the other hand i 'm currently in it in the in the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , so how does that one that that the human ?
how do you because that change ?
the for a comparison with figuring out .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence , <unk> intelligence surveillance .
so , the question was , when we can , when , when we can be a computer building , of this works like the human brain ?
so , and i believe that one , there we 've been fairly close .
so i can think , so two , three hundred years , no longer does n't that anymore .
but let me just do , why you that 's why that maybe <unk> bit of needs .
so the comparison between the computer on the one side and our brains in the other hand .
if we the computer taking , then based yes , all so your smartphone , you tablet , you <unk> , and these cameras and all of intelligent <unk> somewhere on <unk> little chip .
he calls to <unk> , central <unk> unit .
these are parts composed of tiny transistors .
the word has certainly , for anyone heard and in <unk> it will always so as a triangle time .
this <unk> little device , that has three <unk> and forth for electricity , or not .
in our computer in our <unk> we have , i did , an extra <unk> ago about five hundred million of these little parts .
and the turn on there all mixed up .
we save things , we we do things , we have degrees ' i just albert einstein tell you hear , yes , 'n computer can all can be very much , very quickly but actually he can just zero and one compare .
more it ca n't .
he 's actually quite it sucks .
we want it 's compare with our brains .
our brain has a smallest unit the neuron , the nerve cell and we have them , there too did i <unk> , a hundred billion , so a hundred billion neurons are in our gray mass up here in .
this beautiful but is , our our neurons have not only three connections but that have up to <unk> a neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just just because it 's beautiful , is 10 trillion .
this is that 10 to 14 zeroes <unk> .
so there is what you 've been the complexity of our brain is to a higher than that what we now , when computers have .
we want to the <unk> time now , perhaps the one or other know of , the first supercomputer , who had their own power station next door up , ha the <unk> , and with the <unk> the <unk> was the campus <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> <unk> sometimes as well , but the box up here it takes about 20 watts .
and of is and this is , the equivalent of two of bananas , so more you have n't and you your calculator up there 's wonderful .
if we now <unk> giant good part up here , <unk> giant good calculator with <unk> , why we 're using the then not , why forget we then things ?
maybe you know the one or another these ads on the internet , so , the human uses only 10 percent of his brain , buying now you this <unk> to the <unk> brain to be .
and <unk> there <unk> , the advertising a little .

that 's probably not happen because we that does n't use .
why it seems and so that we the most part of <unk> let ?
maybe you know , the term of <unk> ?
of i compared , of and so nice to the <unk> , if you the <unk> see , in the sea , it is , up so the top , it 's the <unk> , there 's a <unk> .
and these 10 percent up , this is that 's about that which our <unk> , our <unk> mind is , <unk> 's but <unk> percent , is a giant <unk> off , <unk> .
we <unk> the point that we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> <unk> slow but we <unk> creative .
and , in time <unk> on this memory back , maybe you know the one or other people with <unk> memory .
people , and suddenly , much more detail can remember when i did n't seen , ' in the situation <unk> , and the tell you <unk> , i did ' said yes , but now , but , where you know that ?
this is , because there 's very , there 's a special , called a <unk> , so someone with <unk> , somebody the most on a field <unk> , the excellent , is the has a so good <unk> memory , of it was in a plane , on , in a plane , in a helicopter , so fast is , he then ow , not , over rome flew , has to rome looking at yes , so rome 's right now ow , not necessarily the smallest city , has to then , a gigantic signs of faith to and has started , rome to draw .
and not somehow , so here that river , and there is , that , no , every single house , every single door , every single window has he once seen , he <unk> , it could back to put on paper .
how do here 's this ?
so why ca of this , why we ca n't that , well , the true is perhaps pretty close , that the <unk> bit more access to his <unk> percent <unk> has .
now we 're using the , as , but why can i 'm now not on the at the <unk> last night remember , in all the little things ?
'n <unk> <unk> of me has to interesting experiences done .

wonderful , so that came the very good for sure .
now , it but a matter of the people <unk> to do .
there 's got it in a very safe session , at the end or after this event <unk> can , even if you do n't more active remember it could , she could then the hallmark of the car see , where these people <unk> , that was n't <unk> , that was their 40s meters on .
and actually is with this hallmark of the one 's composed been .
the second what i really great found was , he was a lady in <unk> had , that has told , their mother her and alice in wonderland reading to have when she was little , so four years .
there was it on your lap her mother and her mother has read .
and then he 's her words , in <unk> , <unk> but time ago .
then she has begun read , she was four than that happened , they could then we have n't read today , can you that .
and they then has said he said , tell me , the <unk> .
they 've actually a specimen from alice in wonderland found , where right on this side of text said , the the lady reading to have .
the brain has so this page such as she was <unk> , as a picture .
and then she could read .
so yes , we actually have access to this , but we seem there in ordinary lives we say <unk> kind <unk> to have , for us to not <unk> .
, now , we did n't that event at the , but how <unk> have said , he was there a a a picture seen , a , a a <unk> , we store , rather our <unk> , so that what we see that , what we smell , that what we hear , that what we taste and that what we feel , hey , if you now <unk> at a yellow <unk> thinking and you there 's get <unk> <unk> , you <unk> sense , like the taste , very all example .
and , it was now <unk> upon here tonight , they and yet , <unk> comfortable down , ha , <unk> slightly up and , then i must ask you , just yet , they just a very quickly your eyes .
and remember , at a very <unk> , positive event in the recent past , yeah .
and take the first , which is coming .
and , if you that now do , will you might notice , it to this memory a visual part .
they get maybe a picture , maybe even a movie ?
some land that does not only on , because we this so normally do , but that they make the first time aware .
and if you see that , then it can be , they either in the movie is , from their eyes are all experience , or as you to see themselves on a screen .
this one we call <unk> , another , <unk> .
thank you , you get the idea to solve , get to the way back up .
who has because a visual information get , let 's hand up ?

well , put ' <unk> on .
<unk> what it is beautiful at the memory , if you memories <unk> , is where itâ€™s not just this memory up , <unk> <unk> feeling that , we <unk> a positive event and i was , the one or other smiling can see , there was so yes , it was beautiful , there were , yes , they laugh , and it 's the memory may still there , in fact , we with our memories , beautiful or other feelings off .
and now is what exciting .
<unk> it previously was , yes , you that our brain power of the point no difference between what we actually reminded , and with what we have just imagine , what we have conceived .
and that you can try out , if you to to home <unk> sit down and to something in the future imagine , which is not yet happened , they 're similar information into how do something , if you to something remember what the past was .
and , , you know , like these stories that you , so here in social situation round , of time .
then , hey , there is that happen and that , and that was so beautiful , and the longer these stories <unk> , the beautiful 're mostly the stories , hey , there were the people have a lot drunk , there was the evening , a lot social situation , there was the sunset , a lot of romantic , there was the waterfall , much higher .
if we it been in then do , so if we really our memories so changing , why we do this because not take action , question i you ?
<unk> , when i think came , has to my uncle an image showing everybody , of his hut that in switzerland .
a very nice image , it 's also a beautiful shack .
just , this picture is ' <unk> bit more than the shack , so it 's artistic freedom , he told me , well , there 's the shack <unk> bit around , there is ' 'n bit more gras that , there 's a beautiful dog that , because it emanates the sun in the alps , this is quite a picture of the shack , does not to make .
and why we do this because not with our own thoughts , our own memory , hey , what bothers me of because , if it even more do , at what i 's degree think ?
they 've actually artistic liberty in their own thoughts .
<unk> you know , so some people , the that they do you see in the morning , if you just like this gray have eyes , which is because this ?
yes i did , bad slept , i went all the <unk> by the head .
really all the night and this idea made me not more off .
i think this is in reverse the he made the idea not going .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he to germany was , because his mother in <unk> stayed and he did you just awful missed .
what the father has done , so he has to each night with the son sat down and has said , or has asked , so , which was because the most beautiful , which today 's happened ?
what was because the most beautiful , just tell time , and then he have to tell let , did it <unk> let , did it kind tell let , which today amazing happened .
and , within two weeks went 's the son <unk> .

and of today is the that , all the youth who made with the , of today is one of <unk> people that i know .
so there 's not the memory , the us some control , in the way that we are , but it 's our focus on it , our focus on that are thought we use .
and how much energy we to stop wasting or use .
so if you <unk> <unk> thought <unk> or say , , that was today now ow , that 's so , <unk> this practice , but i really not , then they make it 's but let 's like , you know it may tom <unk> in this <unk> fiction film and it has these , this <unk> computers where he his files <unk> <unk> , do that but also time , they look for her image , that <unk> have of this , well , not so at a have , they say , yes , well , <unk> now <unk> happening now , bam , way that .
so ham , we because <unk> ' yet , ah , what turned , yes <unk> time there , <unk> , there is that has to <unk> ' real love , man , that was that was beautiful , you know ?
and then you take but that time with .
and take that to in their <unk> and you make this work .

so , and take so again , the image , they <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , you make the background horses jump , yes , they laugh , why things you ?
because they <unk> imagine , because of thinking funny are .
and they do much better with the situation of them .
ca man memories so these ?
no , i think our brain has that kind of capacity , it all , can .
it makes but nothing , because we can free vote , how powerful we the focus and how important we an event , a memory , a thought rate , it comes to explore .
my plea for you , at them , they play with the images in your mind , you use the power of your <unk> and they give him every day <unk> , the their lives sink .
yes good afternoon .
thank you for the invitation .
if i in a party asked me , what i like in my spare time doing and tell , i together with friends a <unk> <unk> and go , then i see shining eyes and in the minds of my audience the connotation of <unk> crowds , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> come up .
if i then <unk> , it on , the <unk> to a <unk> to classical music is , and then they 're in front of these <unk> crowds pictures of old people that in right now , long <unk> in <unk> spaces are and very focused the art listen .
frank <unk> once said , about music to talk is so how about architecture to dance .
and so much more and this also with what we do .
so they still a glimpse get what i just speaking , i did you a short film brought .
film
<unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
that does it in my view at the best on the point .
since <unk> is that <unk> from the <unk> got out , something completely different to do .
we makers are today is between <unk> and middle , at two decades old and have very early in our youth experienced , which incredible force and pleasure to classical music <unk> .
we have but also know , the mores of <unk> and of <unk> us there some happiness , well , a little <unk> can .
and we are the solid belief that called the crisis of the classical music not at the content , so on the music ourselves but at their <unk> it .
so let 's imagine the question , how we can a <unk> create , that the music the near , the friends and this power back there , the way that we as much of you like .
how we can a <unk> organizing , and beyond the mores of <unk> work ?
we imagine the parameter , that you from the classic concert know , space , time , light , context , basically in question .
so take for example of the relationship between audiences , and musicians .
usually it 's between the stage and the audiences a gap .
we 're trying to the effect .
now you a picture of our <unk> .
the musicians sitting in the audience , drink beer , entertain , in the 're with the audience , standing on , playing a , two pieces , put it back in an audience .
all this is in the course of the night a little <unk> .
everybody , the craving has <unk> , coming on stage and goes back .
or that are sitting in the concert .
in the classic concert it 's so , you on more or less <unk> , permanent chairs , so much like , you sit and ahead to look and listening .
but it music , because you ca n't actually sit still .
and we have to worry done , how do you that work .
if you way you sit and to a <unk> piece of music <unk> can , then hear them automatically the way you .
yet to come , we with this concert does n't a stage had , but four stages in the audience around .
the audience could , yes <unk> .
so sitting on the night every once in the front row .
important for us is that we 're not just any events are doing , but that we of the music from thinking .
that we us so , `` that are rooms and <unk> around but also in the minds from the people need the music , it 's how do can as you do is to ?

but not just the spaces around and the illumination can music become alive now go and now , but also the connection with other arts .
and so we are totally happy that we 've been a few years with the <unk> work together , the with us dances , or movement to music to <unk> the developing really did n't the dance been written is .
and so we get then <unk> for <unk> of beethoven , or for <unk> by steve rich .
and in this year , we have a , yes , if you like to , <unk> complete .
we have the first time a concert together with a <unk> implemented .

that has of all , that works , because we a big <unk> had us , in this piece of who has .
we have about a <unk> much money from people all of germany them , so that 's what we <unk> could .
at all this is <unk> something which from a community that arises .
we 're totally happy in the closeness of <unk> in the town <unk> a home found to have .
the city which is that just as big that we great rooms and exciting place for performing work , but also that small , we notice .
if beginning of the year in the spring two weeks forty <unk> all of europe in the city are , then drops on just , that in the city more people with <unk> around as usually .
the whole <unk> will <unk> organized .
we makers are a want mixture of students and students , physician , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really totally totally up .
and in a <unk> a <unk> <unk> , this so the <unk> or coordination and funding in the eye keep , <unk> to seven to 10 makers in a <unk> , the for a year for a compulsory for jobs are taking .
it also <unk> , but you care , for a year about that for example that <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> in solid hands are and to the <unk> actually managed to .
we do that all in our leisure and live in very germany distributed .
this is , the most part of labor is have and on a <unk> .
just three times the year we make us about the year distributed to an extended weekend , <unk> , to talk about the one or other problems that popped up are , and caring for also the interpersonal together , that just hugely important is if you something like in motion to keep .
for <unk> even come and twenty or 30 volunteers workers that , the for a few days or a few weeks their hands being and there is where help it 's needed , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and obviously in these 14 days , the musicians this .
now you could mean , so you have all you for such a <unk> needs .
but our <unk> goes on .
we have which is in <unk> in the city a large community around us around , sort of us , supported in the what we want to do .
it goes from the classic <unk> off , that 's but also about very practical things like for example of the properties , because we have a baker , of us to bread <unk> or a <unk> us , fresh food available to imagine .
this <unk> is in a <unk> in the city there about the year done and sells .
up to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> a whole lot of individuals found us , their living room available to imagine , so the musician and samples can .
and on this way of this is that <unk> to something give in this city has become and of the people in this city .
they identify and on a very particular way of with this <unk> .
since the beginning of the year we could you <unk> support of the citizens in place a <unk> to live out , the right now the entire endeavor in a sustainable and reliable power <unk> turns .
we makers of the stage believe that classical music <unk> , provided it comes into the right hands .
therefore we 're incredibly happy about this is , in all across europe young musicians music in their own hand , and home to , and in cities <unk> hold .
if you to go still , not really can imagine , you do it feels like , classical music as to experience , then they come but just over .
the next year we 're back in <unk> and we would we look forward , if you then , there are .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you think maybe you know acquire .
you heard about this for learning or the effect of learning , but i mean , to learn heard even more , which is also <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> win .
know , experience , <unk> , a beautiful formula for the <unk> .
what i of art and culture 've learned , well , because i can a lot of course to say , because now ar <unk> <unk> i mean , in this field .
and why i 'm thinking about , that maybe it really would be , this thing <unk> called a different <unk> have to give , what my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , does but much work .
they 've also now laugh .
you get whatever the laughter , despite the most of the saying know .
why is that ?
i think that has to do with , that the word pretty something <unk> , what we 're not really capture can .
art , that we say , sometimes , that 's what .
to work we say that could , that 's what .
sometimes even .
the the people like to work , that 's what to me .
but at work we think more in the <unk> and at the art more in the realm beyond the everyday , where we us in moving , our experience collect , our own ideas evolve .
and , so i mean <unk> that i you now <unk> want , in about three hours in five actually shared , all the <unk> have , with a i start , so it for them just is .
it starts with the <unk> , for the childhood , goes on the inspiration , for my adolescence , i 'm not all tell from my adolescence , n't worry , is then on , the word <unk> i 'm later , why i that for my <unk> actually have .
the interaction for the first of my professional life and finally , five , identification .
<unk> one of you will this is these pieces of <unk> sebastian stream know .
<unk> , two- and <unk> .
you learn so it in the first two , three years ago , if you 're reasonably practice , and i have -- practiced .
and so with 10 , 11 , i have these little bits played , on piano , not far from here , at the <unk> , to home .
these pieces of life from a <unk> .
there 's a melody played and the different voice <unk> , but it 's very differently .
the rhythm is that same , but it 's <unk> .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something <unk> at the art , it that succeeds , and if it 's only two votes are , <unk> together , together to think , if that the present , the future , the past sometimes it 's in , beginning , images , in <unk> , in <unk> , things that <unk> are , in the right now bring together , it makes the art from .
and i have to learn , two distinct melodies , sometimes , three , at the <unk> <unk> , simultaneously , to play , any kind of yet to hear , the one highlight , the other not .
this was that what i there 've learned , among other things .
one another experience i 've never forget and i have the worry about , it me today may also like to be .
i have the piano <unk> , there were even more people in the hall and here today , and middle of <unk> i came out .
i it had forgotten .
what i memorized played .
so again , of forward started and at the same point i knew , not on .
the audience has more <unk> almost as i , because i went in all quiet on my place , brought my notes , put them up and started the third time of forward .
and they do n't think , like that i <unk> have for .
but that was a very heavy experience .
perhaps that was also one of experiences , where i then you know , well , with the piano , although i then quickly a <unk> had , i should not be my <unk> go , because to talk you can easier to cheat .
yes , the next the next chapter my <unk> , i mean <unk> with inspiration and also because i want to tell stories .
when i then so <unk> was , i went to my <unk> and told him , rather mr. <unk> , i 'd like a <unk> play .
and he said , oliver , that 's not .
there you have a lot of coffee houses and visit , and very much experience with women raised have .
now , imagine time ago , a <unk> young man , so , young , such a sentence .
the i 've obviously not forget .
and of on , you have , i even more practiced .
now i was actually , and to time in a <unk> .
i 've practiced , and i remember me of a situation , i like never more 've experienced .
it was that <unk> of <unk> of chopin and now i get to the part of work , i have a place it does n't have , and she was with the most beautiful spot , very broad you had the poor do , and then the back together and back apart .
i do it now unfortunately n't going to play , is not a piano here , and i may also not anymore .
i have this place two decades , 30 times if played and suddenly got them properly .
and then i keep them playing and <unk> , i 've got me into a <unk> played , and i know , just , i 'm suddenly on the floor because when and laugh .
i was except me .
i had nothing to , nothing in fact , and the music that , with me done this .
an experience , where i 've learned , emotions , really as .
and sometimes is it right , for to work , that in this <unk> <unk> , in this condition , i call it time , of <unk> .
where all of yourself going .
we had this situation in fact , then in the <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was then almost anything like by itself , when we the <unk> did , that , just and months for , where you usually a half years for would need .
so , that were my experiences with the piano , with art , yeah , with artistic work .
and now i get to my <unk> , <unk> .
i was first , as a musician way , but i just as <unk> .
we 've got into playing , <unk> , <unk> .
i 've <unk> given and got me and so it certainly next to my <unk> for the music to engage can and that <unk> wished .
in the choir singing , collectively , breathing , a <unk> singing , great experiences , the me very , very moving on enriched have .
and then came a point where i as <unk> in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> went am , in the <unk> and the overhead , and i have this is why with <unk> <unk> , this chapter , because there me that <unk> came , or that this idea came from , this combination of art , culture , i was then , <unk> also just in the <unk> entered , politics and to law school a job to do .
which is the art , culture to place , to my <unk> to do .
so here are working for the art , but i just not as artists , but otherwise , you would not like i say <unk> , but as <unk> <unk> and keep doing things .
i was there in theater and got me <unk> , there was in germany , no <unk> for <unk> , just in vienna , there , i did , and of on , you have i 'm always more with this question busy , what you can do , in art to enable , in the framework for art to improve , in a good management , a good state administration building ?
and that was the reason why i then also n't stop at 'm in my workforce , in towards this <unk> , and with <unk> years ago , i was , then <unk> .
but before that was another <unk> , and this phase , i mean <unk> with interactions .
<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> has its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , though sometimes in my c.v , because i in <unk> there was , whatever it says , the <unk> oliver <unk> , about <unk> i me , i need this kind of time <unk> .
but i did n't a <unk> root , because my grandparents maternal were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i have the carnivale experienced .
this was i 'd like something which i do n't like the 've suddenly , i was get sucked into another form of culture , in a <unk> , in a culture , who lived , of people in this in this <unk> device of <unk> .
once the carnivale on us <unk> , were all in a completely different situation , in very different states .
and i was then with <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , of my friend and colleague was , since then we have always for the <unk> tonight music done , he guitar , i piano , one more people 's a bass played for instance , could then i memorized <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> done , so , but of course , to texts of <unk> <unk> , <unk> practiced .
and this carnivale , it was really from the people out .
it was my destiny , i at the ninth november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> did n't even with , the wall fell .
i woke up the day on , i was oral exam , oh , the wall is really like , yes .
got me more quickly prepared to , in any questions for <unk> .
and down there was i <unk> for the cities in the east germany .
and there was , i experienced , what interactions like our place between two german culture .
actually , we speak the same language , the music is there too fine , and was really playing , but a lot was <unk> , <unk> .

now is germany , <unk> .
now is also on the <unk> much more <unk> places .
interaction , i then , but in all things here learned and experienced , in the city food .
we have the first that i had actually a <unk> , and imagine that time ago , when i here 's started , <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> for culture and play .
i have that have .
his hands up for <unk> , you did n't write <unk> for culture , <unk> .
i was which is the first of the head <unk> .
so i have with not much so , or was that 's wonderful , i these <unk> had , but you go out , because i then for education in charge , and make alliances to education do and shape could .
we have very much for the urban affairs done , we have the if you only time that <unk> between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> see what we there to have , the <unk> experience , <unk> , where you interactions between beginning and architecture would be , from <unk> to <unk> at the blue stones .
many , many of we could and i could make and i 've experienced , and realized , what that mean when different people from different areas combined a goal . and
you can actually , i always more <unk> of the art , and more to the culture , the us makes us , that <unk> between humans , between cultures , between community , better said , in the view , and i come but later on the art back .
interaction was also then between the <unk> the subject as we , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea had , at when january <unk> , that <unk> could be in the <unk> europe for .
but this last chapter , this one fifth one chapter one has yet the <unk> identification .
this word , yes two meanings , for a , i <unk> me with something , <unk> me so to something , and i do it but also as verb use and say , i <unk> something that is , i know something .
and it 's always in his <unk> .
i know something with his <unk> , so i say , i <unk> you or the or that community .
and i <unk> me with something , if i me to <unk> and say , that moment to me , with the i want to identify .
and that 's a very big campaign had been .
five point three million people trying , to move , <unk> cities , and to identify the double sense , to <unk> and to realize that you a community is in europe .
as big , we have , it <unk> called , but anyway , as a community of many people that in a big <unk> life and yet at least a common language talk , even if <unk> nations are here and this was our <unk> , the identification to start with the people and of them , too much take out .
and the signs , the <unk> the highway , many other experiences .
an experience from the <unk> did n't have so many people did .
so ham 's <unk> <unk> and food , two schools , on , young girl from <unk> , of the <unk> , and young children from a <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , have letter of people , young men , from <unk> to a play processed , the home , say goodbye , love , death , last letter writing have .
and it was already a special effect , that young girl letters of young <unk> up and young russians and letters of young men from germany in something <unk> german .
and there sits down , one of these young men to the piano , and played this <unk> that i so loved .
and at oh , and then they quoted him from a letter and said , i 'm <unk> , he wrote him to home , as young german , the he was , and i can never more a <unk> play , because my my two fingers on <unk> are .
and he <unk> his hands on with a <unk> , sat down again , the piano in that play on <unk> carl and tried , the <unk> to play .
and it could it does n't .
it was for me as a <unk> scene , i ahead to jumped , am i said , what we actually have learned ?
we 've learned , in the <unk> , many people together something can move , but in all things we 've learned that we <unk> years in <unk> in peace life and culture us so together , that we do n't more the minds go , because we different languages talk , we us to identify , to us <unk> feel .
and it 's for me a wonderful experience and you see , it 's going to learn not just about , something to know .
it 's going to learn all about , something to know , and <unk> to win .
and if we 're much up and invention happen , <unk> , if we let it , we us inspire let of art and culture , our own position to relate , in dialogue with the artwork , if we interact and ultimately , in our own identity and then work , by we ourselves with art and culture them so , and then we all made
and i hope that they still many <unk> and <unk> have , they 're those profit to .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think we wait on the first picture thing .
so i have to <unk> to support my <unk> here 's a few slides <unk> .
there are but no scientific slides , but it 's in my <unk> here about , a way to find and me with an issue through , where i think that 's going to the next few years be working on .
by the <unk> words i know now finally , thank you for what ted also means , and i think , in the area <unk> we can this talk about it categorize .
and then i 'd have heard , you the speech in english are supposed , if somehow possible , but , if you look at it , then you see , you would n't understand what i in english to say , i did not directly , it as to say , and so i the talk , but in german left .
how we will die .
i have to them there first of <unk> tell .
<unk> was patient in the hospital , where i the <unk> <unk> , and was bringing down .
she was about <unk> years old and has always like in the may dancing , because it 's also to her husband remember , of the first man , of the war like was then .
and so it 's every year for the first may to dance went and has a dancing and probably even then a <unk> <unk> to a lot to , and then is bringing down and it 's , here on the side you see this , the leg broken , the <unk> .
a few years before she was also been even down and had to the same way , with same reason , well , the left leg broken .
and then i was also been there as a physician and have experienced , as you for weeks on the intensive care , you , to antibiotics was treated , and problems has been , and have the discussion did , what was told , is because that actually makes sense ?
it makes no sense , at a way that old people like this intense 's what to use to get ?
so is , to <unk> , on the intensive care for weeks , it 's a people ever <unk> ?
and they then is fixed been .
five years later i get into the clinic , see the name <unk> , and the i can i 've got you know , because he just so rare is , and for the time back , and it 's the dance in the may , the other leg broken .
it turns out the question , which <unk> i there actually , if i talk about this , as a person for to decide to do , it into his <unk> do or what he also to <unk> which ?
and that 's a little bit of the issue of <unk> .
you see here and the <unk> of called , how we will die .
it 's a book out of <unk> , how we 're working , a report on the <unk>
and then it was so , the globalization very strong pushing left is , so you to ask me has , how do it because go , connected to work ?
you have then , and that you can in this book now also have read , just said , it 's a quality control come , so the parts always fit together .
it 's a networking of working successes , it 's also the work , a lot more you 're going for instance , to china , that was then a big issue .
and this is then also like coming , that basically the work of individuals , so something assemble , something making , and lower <unk> was him , and more control was also of the quality , that he <unk> , of the accuracy .
and that , after my <unk> , the people who always less confidence from their work going to and more and more part of a little <unk> were , where it 's what was , and height of <unk> to reach , and not about , through his work , too to define .
and if we that now , on the <unk> and medical domain , then there 's obviously just one development .
if you in television even hear , what doctors , nurses and also <unk> at the most of lawsuits , then there are the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when there have documents are , what you have done , so it <unk> is , so it even paid is , and if not going to document is , and says the health service 's also , that care or the medical treatment for we do n't .
and so these n't going but the work of <unk> and more <unk> and more and more is getting this idea , you his work too full and to use of personal belief <unk> , in the background to such a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a good friend of me is now after the netherlands gone , because he this is not anymore to , of had a <unk> practice , has the abandoned and is to the netherlands went in , doctor for <unk> to be .
the <unk> are on these developments usually a piece forward and he , of martin , had just experienced , that always more old people shuttle between the nursing home , hospital , and there back because the <unk> not more knew what they should go , if it 's the people got worse left .
then come into the hospital , will restored to go back into the senior home , or nursing home , and be there on those .
and that a family physician was to just thought , if it is something like structured in the netherlands is , then i want to me there like to form now , in something here promote , you from this cascade of <unk> and of also <unk> <unk> of people <unk> can .
there now , in holland got to it however , let after he the language with trying much learned had learned , that there 's what the same thing happens , what about this <unk> happened .
it 's also the dying is a quality control introduced .
it 's no longer the credibility , the count , but you put even in a really notice , i want for example n't problems are , or not the hospital , if i in nursing home am .
and then that will <unk> .
in the netherlands is like , the third day is a conversation with the newly admitted instead , and the need to then they commit ourselves , i want the hospital or i do n't want more the hospital , if me something happened .
so just like to the , i want to problems are or i want to do n't problems are .
this data go then at a central and there is that doctor for <unk> , has always the <unk> ago , and you could use then the decision on that basis .
if we now , <unk> back , that i 'd like in the may dancing , and also even down was , and imagine ourselves , that would eventually a <unk> wrote , i want to do n't problems are , then it would this second danced in may in the may , where they then back down is , admittedly , not more can experience .
and this raises my friend now , of there in the netherlands is , also very much <unk> , he 's deal with that is to .
in the past it 's like that <unk> today about <unk> to seventy percent of people do n't more to home die , but in hospitals , institutions , and that these institutions 's also , so you can that sense , not the ideal living systems are for old people , but it 's often a tightly those tightly <unk> window closes down , the <unk> are often <unk> and the promotion at and for yourself this <unk> find there , after my experience , just constrained happening .
it 's quite homes , that this very good way , there 's very <unk> people , and there will , but if i 'm the <unk> see , and we have about <unk> patients in the year , so , so roughly five , six thousand , that perhaps from <unk> to us admitted to be , then i would for me say it is quite difficult , there cope and be within self-worth keep up .

this is today just not the fact , but you need two salaries in <unk> and <unk> and often enough , it also just close .
this introduction of systems as a consequence of the growing market , the you adjust to , it , and so , on the individuals concerned out .
and now i get that , how to the maybe you can escape , so what we do now in the past , because i did well first questions asked , and this , so easy for is the situation for affected not .
and since i 've just time that <unk> <unk> and the article one me there <unk> , because i think , a society is going like this structure , and legal structure , at that we all the <unk> , what happens in our society .
and in <unk> article one is just , the dignity of people 's pretty much untouchable .
and the second set up there is to save them 's chief justice mission of all <unk> .
and what i sometimes is missing is still a third set in there is , which is anyone is also for to the mandate to have , his was going to protect and to defend .
because it a way is themselves , to free from this case , i 'm going to this other way , and the supposed to me here kind of who and provide food and then you need something i 'm at least not thinking about doing , as i because even die 'm going .
because in the past it is yes , so , even if we have this subject does n't like to imagine , we will eventually to the point come .
hopefully , until late , with hundreds or <unk> .
the equivalent of my career as well , to say , that i wish everyone and since i want to also to worry , but eventually you going to the theme do need , and if it then maybe so far is or even just , if you <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is , it can already late in life to be late in life be to say , i want about this question now even think .
so if you think about , what makes my going out , then you going on the coming , where then the last out , what 's because actually the five major things in my life has been ?
there now there 's a book , what fairly en <unk> is .
it 's the self-esteem of course , there are then the friends , i have , with whom i 'm talking and exchange can , the know me and the me through the life with , it 's the <unk> .
it 's sure that trust between humans , with whom i may also to do have , in <unk> or in <unk> area or a pastor or a <unk> or just other people , with whom i in relationship right .
and there are there 's a lot of those factors of course , that there <unk> , i go the right now , not all through .
but if you to these three points here has been looking at , then you here has been a lot of tasks , how they in life there may <unk> must , in the past its own going to protect .
and then coming then another one another factor that , that we 're a certain dictatorship of <unk> experience , i did this one time , such as a text , or as a as an example of taken .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior , which there <unk> , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
we would be just from ourselves to come out .
so it 's not the question , which are because others to me to do , who 's going to me because the power , caring for , or to me use , who goes up to me ?
but it 's exactly what other way , to ask , where i can on people <unk> , where i can me bring and by my inner would get , i with these questions deal can and me there reposition and reframe can .
and if you and says , how we 're working , so this inside these systems us , the outside of sat up was , it 's a way , to say , how i define me about my my inner would , this mechanism to escape .
because no man can i dictate how , i 'm himself because look and reposition want .
and i 've got there , not fit into in general <unk> or opinions must say , , you have now a <unk> fill and because you been so old are , imagine you exactly , if you problems are going to , if you on an icu want to go .
these questions that i can in the last only to long <unk> probably <unk> do .
this would of people 's one of posture , the in me , and the not the outside of how can be , the state of not can protect , also a law not , and that i also other people <unk> can and i rather <unk> be , if i 'm just there themselves before with which <unk> 've got , so that also know what i of a person am .
and in those conversations to lead , it does it 's spaces , and since i think , and why i this talk so called , and on here has been troubling , are those spaces like this <unk> in food , that i did you is both tried , on a picture times <unk> , rooms , where we over these issues need to think , where a <unk> room , so it does n't hurt is that it also may not to now is , but that 's a conversation there is happening .
so we , if we then old are , it certainly can say , oh , such a dance in the may , despite my may very high ages , that would be more times what .
i thank you very much for listening .
beautiful good evening .
i 'm two things with .
if you the first part to flat , is keeping you to a little <unk>
it 's still a second .
we start with the infinite possibility of .
this is really dumb , not , can take you .
what you mean ?
there 's different <unk> ?
or is infinite enough ?
yeah .
this is not good if this one of it 's , of what 's .
so , in fact , but i 'll it off , for the , the know it .
it 's what we do n't .
we engage us with just a single .
and i frontier that like a little off the finite .
<unk> , <unk> know , we are we form us a to know .
and it 's for the <unk> to guesses of vast amounts .
if we 're in the finite coming which are , and add two <unk> , in the one example , chairs , in the other people .
we know , suppose , already now , we look in the box goes in , the number is small , there are three chairs and there are three people .
we can we 're , whether in any amount of the same number of elements in there is ?
count , how it would do ?
this is , we 'd just the people <unk> , one , two , three , we get the three , we count the chairs , see three chairs , one , two , three , three and three three is three , and beautifully .
that you mean , yeah ?
very beautiful .
that work in the finite wonderful , that can also at large numbers , although it 's .
but it does .
how do you it 's counting ?
how do you just check , that so many people like chairs out there are ?
i 've realized chairs and people , and not what else .
<unk> make !
we call this mate .
you well , that it 's obvious , not , now we 're in everyday life on the road , and understand that also all !
not , that 's very beautiful .
so , we call this , professional a <unk> and it works as well , yeah ?
you take a , you 'll get them on a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> , way , the next <unk> , everything is use , different people get different chairs , not a chair with is being empty and the amount are same size , okay ?
now we go into the infinity .
how we can two an infinite amount to compare ?
we would say , the one is that big or bigger or smaller than the other .
we could we do it ?
we would back to start .
right , that 's wrong , because the point is the , if you in an infinite long lot of start to count , yes , i 'd let 's just say they do n't come to another .
<unk> , infinitely , is clear , <unk> ?
so how does it ?
madame ?
no way , madame !
they did the but i just really started .
mate .
so now this so let 's the time in .
estimate , estimate is in the infinite always bad , yeah ?
you see , you see there is n't one , yeah ?
the point is this , you do it really easy .
if i for example , the <unk> suppose , natural numbers , <unk> , we computer scientist use the zero in the beginning , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we would say , we time , a copy that <unk> and take from this piece of the infinity thank <unk> pay off .
be left who just numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all straight numbers are <unk> on the infinity long line of natural numbers , but on the a band missing the <unk> , in the other are the line and the <unk> on it , okay ?
we call the a lot of zero-g the straight numbers , we call the other lot of several of natural numbers .
what you think ?
is g more powerful , it 's bigger than through n , same size or smaller ?
same size ?
it 's very shares , yes , where a missing , the <unk> .
who 's a different estimate off ?
smaller ?
who says bigger ?
ah , that has itâ€™s really did n't plan , yeah ?
that can , as not be , yeah ?
they could n't , where what 's missing , bigger , that wo n't really , <unk> ?
okay , they say smaller ?
you would suspect , not ?
this is the popular , what you course , course is wrong .
and now and now i 'm , why the amount are alike .
how does it ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the line of , we take the zero from the natural lot , mate , out .
the next one of zero , and plus two is two , after the zero does the one , and i 'll get back a <unk> .
the four , the two , the six , the three that eight , the four , yeah ?
you can that even reverse , then it doubled , it 's obvious , <unk> ?
and it 's clear , by the <unk> do we make it that that i make it always in the lecture is a <unk> <unk> .
and this one , there 's just the line looked and the band is a long , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural on the line , <unk> , the <unk> are out and the band is still a long .
this is it just in the infinite .
so if you some explain what we have today learned , have infinity learned , yes , which is because no end , i know just finally ?
an infinite amount of has a feature , that there 's the finite just not and this feature is , is an absolute <unk> a true , a subset of the just as large is .
that they make the finite not if you from three three people are two people <unk> , it 's just another one there and previously were 's three .
yes , so we 've infinity done .
is not <unk> ?
okay .
then we do still a second part , probability .
the professionals , strongly genetic probability .
well here what brought .
with this experiment i am i 'm sure , it 's at least a third know and <unk> it does anybody with this , on it has , yeah ?
so , we call the doors a , b , c .
i 've got behind anything hidden , i hope that you have 's not ours .
and you to now once guess .
where , you mean , i have something hidden , behind a , b , or c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
you appreciate , c .
who has yet another idea ?
a ?
who has another idea ?
made nice , <unk> , b has <unk> , do n't otherwise , sounds of itâ€™s not on , <unk> ?
this is right .
it 's really wildly anyway , so they have to do n't think , the three letters to fall and i 'm looking me one .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it is yes , right , because , the the opportunity , she has lucky , is yes has only in a third .
<unk> , there are three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i here , i 'm just one on .
well , i of course , where it 's .
<unk> , that has to anybody here , <unk> .
so , i know , yeah , where it 's because it , guess and appreciate that or as well , you it 's called , goes into a second round .
so i 'm now actually the game explain , i basically now only <unk> .
so it 's so , we go into a second round .
now , suppose , i <unk> me on that a , <unk> ?
so , now i have a door show , behind the n't it 's and that they do n't have said .
because if you now , b say , and i say , and i know , yeah , it 's not of b .
then there 's itâ€™s not a second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , sorry about .
but i have to yes , it 's <unk> , in the second round go .
so i can only one up , behind the it 's not just not is , but what they also do n't have said .
now is the question , and this is that strongly genetic likely , under the 'm here has remained , under the condition that b open is , and it does n't there is , you now your last chance , news to guess .
they must now in a remain , then i do necessarily a on .
i do now this on , what they want .
or they say , i do c on .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with this know more likely gone ?
phew , very beautiful , b is on , now i know , it 's behind c .
or but , thank god is , b opened 's been , i wanted forever , at a remain , this is it .
or would you say it , is n't <unk> , we have , <unk> , way that , we 've just have two doors , now it anyway , to change or to stay .
what you mean ?
it 's not care .
<unk> .
why is no matter ?
very beautiful .
why it 's why is it <unk> ?
yes , right , that 's wrong .
this seems like i almost as if we it yesterday <unk> have , <unk> ?
but so they are , <unk> , are a new no , fun .
so , this way , the thing is very <unk> , yes .
that get all between , do n't know , six and yes , i ca n't <unk> years ago , you can i just not more well , <unk> ?
so , it <unk> really everybody .
behind this door is because it to a third .
and it 's always just to a third of a door .
you can guess , what you want , they have with two <unk> you would be in the dirt .
this is , they would be able to two doors guess , not , that you can yes , at <unk> do , you can yes , to two dozen and put it is yes , <unk> , if you the zero , <unk> , this is it , everything in life .
but here we 've just a door .
so now this is this way , two thirds it 's not what you guess .
so this is two thirds here , but it ca n't just behind a door lie !
behind the it 's not .
so , which is then more likely ?
no way , i really have it on !
so , which is now more likely ?
it 's better , to stay , or to change ?
now it 's easy , yeah ?
yes , of course .
so , that was now not hard , <unk> ?
ha !
what we see ?
they 've got unlucky wished .
why ?
very simple , as well two thirds are not a hundred percent , the difference between theory and practice .
i hope that it was to anyone what in .
thank you .
mr. <unk> , they me , jamie oliver <unk> , of this moment of bad food and bad food and overweight people news has , this depressed -- one , completely .
but i <unk> , my best , that the after all over again 's gone , these experiences .
i come , because of <unk> farm and did until i 12 was no mcdonald 's .
so here has been to onto , right .
, yes .
thank you for the invitation today .
i 'm here in the close up .
and i do n't see , mr. <unk> , so on it came , me to ask if i at ted at sea up to and over a particular topic want to talk .
i 've got me <unk> <unk> : issue that trust .
right , motivation is not too bad and i <unk> me the woman <unk> of the has said , maybe power of a or other after more sports .
if only i also full of this to have .
so today night at the rain more to do jogging to go to be now <unk> a tall order , but i have to this morning in fact , training , because i in three weeks at <unk> june , at <unk> , of <unk> to oslo to go to want to 'm half a -- that are <unk> away .
so i 'm going morning when rains this training do n't saves .
so who what to , <unk> , go tomorrow early on , in <unk> , i <unk> ' they all very much a .
i did ' 've been said already , briefly , i <unk> ' <unk> the issue of trust .
and i was , started , shot , with the subject <unk> .
n't worry , the beauty , little bit of essentially refuse , the blind faith comes after <unk> .
i did , before me just thought about it made , when i <unk> 'm how to describe i best at where i <unk> ?
so , i come out 'm village with six houses , thank <unk> , some <unk> and at my parents on the farm there 's an apple apples , <unk> and <unk> -- and what makes you from <unk> , beer .
trust , in sports , not going in <unk> but at me , <unk> and beer .
why talk , i the story , where i 'm from ?
for me is one of very important stories , i really that 's get from the country , from village get ' and there were raised me with two big brothers , with the oldest brother , the <unk> is .
and with the other brother , the same blind is i do .
is , the see light and dark , the can like i just as well know where <unk> window in space , whether it light at is or out .
what today , very convenient is for the energy .
the , or we both can actually see when before us anything is .
'n <unk> , but i say , and i ca n't tell , is <unk> man <unk> <unk> .
of the subject of the old men , <unk> .
and to go tapping into .
and what to me , but whatever it was critical , is obviously , for the fact , how it written you trust and get you saw this great confidence , that <unk> , we all need , <unk> as something <unk> situation , say i time .
and that was for my parents definitely , that you how many of them , of my brother and i still does n't even blind know .
we were so the first , and then quite a sudden in their lives <unk> are .
and then they had from the situation of what do .
and now , <unk> i , it 's a giant fortunate that my parents than farmers do n't the day time had to us to stand and look at the hand to lead or to say , there 's <unk> wall , there <unk> you 'll just along and can then <unk> feel where you <unk> .
i would be the awkward been -- we have home so <unk> .
and b ham our parents of the beginning of us to be , always going to go , where also our <unk> brother is .

there 's the blind brother me then with 'm <unk> <unk> farm pushed <unk> believer in .
that this very complex that this very complex i did until today still .
this is that to the big brothers -- that 's not only good for the elbow but also for the <unk> .
and our brother and and my brothers and i we ham in 'm farm just really that everything out did what ma , you could do , especially for example bike drive .
and that has the <unk> brother with are starting with three years and then we were obviously also -- michael and i .
and have then starting with , <unk> to drive , how they used to a little kids , today with running wheel is that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that can .
but we have that 's starting with <unk> , and lifeless .
and then is the big question : how <unk> ma , there ?
and how do you get that trust , one that trust the parents , the children , and again from the bicycle <unk> and <unk> and making that trust of us that we 're not permanently where this to drive .
and our solution was that we obviously a from our parents tell us have now , where are the <unk> , so where is a car , where <unk> believer , where are perhaps even a kind of an unfamiliar grip things , right homes -- that is now you do n't way -- there , we knew that they are .
and we had to us in between themselves , you how this one can but the other hand , listening .
and that you can now in here , not all of testing , because you will it 's so loud , they did not more of them have .
but <unk> ' evening when they let 's light up and , in their bedrooms , or in whose bedroom , and then themselves will .
you can let 's just try to <unk> <unk> with the tongue , this is to orient and they will find that 's us in people just like to , bats as well -- they 're a resistance listening .
so like bats the way with <unk> are also you hear , now <unk> wall , <unk> resistance because the sound just slightly different <unk> will .
and this is for me in the trust , so trust , in the movement , always very important could .
but <unk> in high <unk> to have and the security , i did ' <unk> chance , i there <unk> piece to help .
and i just to orient no big trouble and right , even without many accidents , the one or other there 's course .
what i 'm sorry , no pictures more , ' , that i really <unk> which is , from one of our <unk> as well as kids .
which is from climb on our higher building on 'm farm .
i did , i wrote , the confidence is also by a <unk> diversity .
and that my ' i 've been very literally , because as man , of a lot also later in <unk> and in the <unk> with confidence in the scientific site has got ' , 'm about one thing never , or i 'm never that stumbled i do it themselves have experienced .
well , of never so you might as dramatically read .
but it has probably also to do with , that it 's not going every so precisely experimentally see what can .
diversity is in the figure out of our strengths with this <unk> , and eventually to know where i 'm good , what i was talent and where i can you saw my strengths really too full <unk> ?
and our brother who again , the did michael and i always took along on top of the house .
so , then said : okay , we ham 's a <unk> .
there you can anywhere from 'm window <unk> of the <unk> for example .
and the by johannes was then right away , michael afterwards and i was , probably been still <unk> little bit like this girl playing , <unk> <unk> , i do n't .
but last end , who is like to the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i believe that one , the others , we 're itâ€™s the generation of young women here , not too .
and of so i 'm stop and yet , with .
and then was hold the consequence , we at all three <unk> <unk> up sitting and the dad with 'm used to 'm <unk> <unk> and did n't even more knew what he now , to tell .
because trust is all of course , then way , when others doubt .
if the father so i said , to god 's sake , help , help , help , then if only , the risk relative size of been , one of us too afraid feel have and in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- do n't know -- somehow <unk> would be .
is , but never happens .
he had to then , so <unk> him , let 's also then slowly <unk> , or by johannes <unk> has us , then returned has .
and that was ' i for me completely awesome , we this opportunity had .
but right , n't worry , that 's not a principal , not necessary , and later <unk> to do .
for me were the different <unk> , the in my life always important were , all , there is interesting .
and especially they were all of <unk> , because i 's also could see , where did i like my borders , what 's maybe that my endowments .
so to <unk> good <unk> i would have never be able .
for that i had never the <unk> .
and i go , until now not like in <unk> .
i go , until today rather out in rain .
now , not at five degrees like the moment .
and at <unk> rain , but nevertheless , rather than the inside his .
but i did ' time for me so this faith in my strengths with found that i different <unk> , well . ''
as first example , <unk> .
and it 's for me be fair , because there , the coach , of us in the <unk> had , has said : okay , we have it louder <unk> children but chic , we <unk> couple of the blind children .
really about it , well , because there are you , you 'll each other at coats .
and then you notice , yeah , what the other power .
and there was always so my big trust , of course , right , when i the competition for take place 'm going 's hard , because then you can the others may yet , what do what i do n't <unk> . ''
so there 's just a way , and this is that confidence in my speed .
the other into a foot in the <unk> let me , yourself backwards fall so , the <unk> head out and then it 's the back and the competition is over , because it 's the full score is there .
i 'll 's there wo n't .
i did it me thinking about but <unk> .
i believe that one ' , this is now <unk> bit risky .
and it could i also now here 's not have volunteers , right ?
<unk> .
shit , i <unk> ' already .
okay .
the next to me an important was a sports in school right then the <unk> and i just <unk> .
my parents were home or are until today <unk> and that you have us , trained as kids .
but for me , and in school hold it matters : how do i myself been much as well , the school move , in my excess energy out ?
and since i had then as a way in school <unk> to do .
and while i actually always thought , that 's all so , <unk> boring , because <unk> is something for the <unk> rather , <unk> ' i .
found , i used to -- <unk> ' i now not anymore .
i was then eventually said : well , i do with the <unk> .
and did , then i just once realized , man , again , this is the great diversity here in the sport , because you <unk> needs , you need power , just some coordination and it <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- you may have a lot also of their work in people ?
this is what it , in <unk> .
you will only then quickly , if you just the full faith in your technology has .
if you that trust in your performance has -- so the force , you that 's also , then , every conditions , the bad weather , the soft snow , the <unk> snow , on the skiing can get .
and if you in my case 's also faith in the team has .
because when <unk> , the n't see , i 'm now depend <unk> <unk> .
and i 's never even things like this hellish freeway on like today -- i have to the word use -- my <unk> -- there was there 's itâ€™s just one -- has already today , my exercise done .
does but nothing that we do you yet again .
or at least i <unk> 's you now maybe just time .
do with a , one , one of them there yet another practice .
what i which is always do the subject <unk> trust , this is the practice , i that the listener to just imagine 'm like it this is if you do n't see just <unk> to make and with their 40s <unk> <unk> .
so in <unk> <unk> , so , you have two sticks in your hands .
of why : yeah , did i do n't hold more free , otherwise might i mean my ' <unk> take and back on the <unk> feel them .
's not .
so i have to me different helping .
i was then my <unk> and , the front of me running .
and the told me with the voice the route .
so the needs to just the exact <unk> do .
and also that 's important to trust .
precise the in communication , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tells me just always <unk> , if it <unk> 's saying , i <unk> and <unk> of saying , then , left to 11 , then i know it 's easy to left , so , so at the upper part of quaint at the pointer .
when he says , left to 10 bit <unk> to left , and when he says , right on 10 .
okay , all understand ?
then <unk> <unk> problem because then i need again <unk> or it needs to me back again , then i know in any case , now is what do n't .
and for me is yes that really big , critical , if the <unk> before me running , then i have to me the really completely <unk> about it 's negative to say .
and it 's inherently to say , he 's for me that supplies , that it enables me to , just really then quickly to be and in <unk> even faster than others , the in the same follow-up competition from now .
and that i can only when i 's just do , with both arms me <unk> , i <unk> , on a leg to stand and i have now actually the eyes to make -- ha ha , or can also open so , which itâ€™s not .
and to then i just like <unk> and to then on the other leg and much again , and get here <unk> bit of balance , but to actually can take away .
it with high shoes .
yes , and this is for me that very important , if i the <unk> 'm just : how <unk> i it , the guy to say , so i 'm guy , because i actually just men as <unk> had , how do i 's the right to say , hey you 've got me the right <unk> do , because the right , the looks like i myself .
the know so not what he tell me to .
so i 'm one , the him the way to communicate just open to .
and that 's like in every <unk> .
if someone my needs not know , he can i 'm not going help , but there i 'm just ask me and to say , well , i need something , of you the trajectory maybe <unk> <unk> used to cool for guys .
or i need something , of you like now , <unk> , that you me just as well , says , as long , the mountain , is because if we the <unk> <unk> , because if you think , at some time : now it must mean by being .
and 're going back in like nuts and thing that 's just not on .
and there practice , i then you 've also time the pilot , how it in <unk> is , on 'm <unk> forward , of me and says we have unfortunately only 20 minutes behind us , because we may -- so we ham recent times <unk> minutes to -- and then they 're 's hold yet another rather <unk> .
of why is that for me , really important , there , the exact , accurate <unk> to have .
i listen '' <unk> -- is what 's probably the other , <unk> <unk> driving ?
who provides more ?
so my best thing was time , for times faster but that was in september and now so in april , may i did it 's true story told is ever so much faster through how <unk> .
and at the forecast weather conditions in the moment , <unk> .
and for me , as i said , are these exact <unk> only then possible if i just mean used to open , ' .
the other me 's also exactly explain what he in order to see me and so the possibility is , my risk perfect an estimate .
and this is for me one of very important things why i say , trust is more training and not this <unk> <unk> .
so stop , it as a blind , not much , frankly i said -- from <unk> .
because i also been the experience was , that i 'm a <unk> right and left wrong cool for guys had .
and then it was in the competition that time bad , because it to the route three meters <unk> .
and i 'm the three feet just <unk> .
of so -- as i said , that was then -- of course <unk> on .
that do i also because the <unk> need to you turn around , have so <unk> <unk> .
and i 'm going on it today , permanent , me that people say , left and say then , <unk> , another , the left .
so was then , right , unfortunately .
power in everyday life often not much from .
but right , in <unk> situation with pressure , that you know you probably also all of the work or the university as well , if it 's rapidly go to .
then is obviously with a lot yes <unk> <unk> hard challenge .
but for me , as i said , is <unk> trust you saw of all that i the risks 've got to .
and since i must be honest say , i am when someone , the n't see , relative size of got the , because i <unk> , my risks in many ways .
so the <unk> <unk> ' i now this kind of all .
by the driving <unk> tree , from falling slope down <unk> , the know i and i <unk> ' but of course , and well that 's the important thing -- i <unk> ' even the good pages .
the which then also be done can , if that trust you saw there .
and if you who has found , of you actually also a hundred percent so <unk> , as i 's just need .
and with the i of all the same goals did . ''
because this is for me in the subject trust you saw the next , very important .
you need the goal and i have just really also clear to be , what does it because actually , trust , go ?
because of is often <unk> faster and language , the you ever used .
i trust the or the or i myself .
but this very important is itâ€™s already , that 's too much on .
that you do that for trust a lot <unk> .
and that you , as -- because we are all with <unk> <unk> <unk> carry out -- we want <unk> meaning and that really see .
and the point , the is quite often , we 's also create , 'n goal together to do .
that we do it -- in my case for example -- from some yes , weeks did i am i on the <unk> gone .
and there <unk> ' i just , i have to me now who seek , the or the i in the case that trust can , that i just this mountain , up <unk> .
and how do you of then , you on the mountain , and actually standing up ?
well yeah , i had of the big advantage , i did , some things we did n't , if it for example , beside me a hundred meters <unk> .
then was me the relatively <unk> .
ca <unk> be an advantage that 's <unk> which is no problem .
and i was , also the back on the <unk> been working now , regardless of the <unk> i am , and to times the did i then that made <unk> <unk> or 'm in berlin <unk> flew , because you going to <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
that 's been <unk> bit <unk> , if you then there standing up and down the car stop , then you have n't been a lot see in , there to know , does now it hurts , if i <unk> .
and these things are for me and what could .
right , and also the <unk> to have but to simply too to know , hey i war , of saying , i 'm there 's how did focus , <unk> and can just by but also got a new new experience have .
and so that <unk> <unk> bit of the <unk> , because at <unk> mountain <unk> , so , you go every day 10 hours before , in , and it 's some simple , just <unk>
you go and goes and has just have stones in order to sit there , and less plants .
you take on <unk> <unk> with , <unk> gun , i 'm first world war we have .
so if you <unk> hybrid see , it 's the <unk> about the last , of the <unk> .
of if only then so that on top .
we have the hybrid just from the distance seen or the other thing .
of so <unk> ' i there <unk> great confidence in the <unk> -- despite his strange <unk> , that he and had .
because i thought , '' : well , so , as i said there <unk> ' i probably faster way , like to the thing that you have .
but as i said , it 's otherwise very <unk> , because you hold about <unk> actually now not really a transformation has .
and really exciting is , then , when itâ€™s something hard it .
so if you then in the height <unk> and the air thinner is .
or if it next to a <unk> , if you then <unk> little <unk> has , where 's left and right <unk> .
then it particularly beautiful and if it then also one night is and all with headlight <unk> , it has us in the <unk> , sometimes even words , now he would i prefer to the wire 's go , so he then i also really in looking and the handle it .
because as only without headlight there <unk> and that was him , but sometimes to risky .
trust , we have this is , that i just said was : well , i can of course of my with her , my friend , that there was , a hundred percent trust , i <unk> ' you and we have this before well <unk> .
but i need something , too <unk> form of security , so i 'm not permanently focus has to , because , can you imagine , if you on the mountain just always say <unk> stone , right right on one , left to 11 .
there you will eventually <unk> , and it 's all .
so for us is confidence in the case been , we 're looking <unk> connection , so ham 's a wire to your backpack attached , that i had in your hands and 'm then behind her in which go <unk> wire all .
had in the other <unk> <unk> , i also to <unk> bit of the height of stairs them did . ''
and it 's then eventually , just are stuck with the foot <unk> stone being or has with your <unk> <unk> stone <unk> , i 's also have already knew what so on me coming and me not permanently just focus had .
and what i the whole thing really showed , how beautiful it 's actually , if you of course realized then eventually , because the peak getting near , you know this is really so again in <unk> near has -- just much like , the <unk> , with the <unk> .
making it 's but also like that i realized , ' , that confidence that i in me , ' , that is , 10 only there , now if i really <unk> goal was , as you saw the top .
but that trust is also for other there , the <unk> , like trust just work .
when we then at night i just the mountain <unk> are , we were in the group of all over again and behind us are the other seven people walked and that were still quite close behind us and it has to each and was someone else behind us and i was already thought : tell ' time , why are the because why watch this because whatever anybody , he 's behind us run can ?
at night you can also the girls not from behind a look .
this is somehow not the reason it seems .
and then did i mean them , oh yeah , ok , right , their faith in their skills is , even at some pretty <unk> .
you go there at night by the dark , you 're going to 12 watch off , has then once no light .

and then , but eventually that the moment where the straight have said yes , we man , that was actually really practical , behind you to go , because the friend of me , i just all explained , we 've always <unk> -- like that women hold this is how do .
have all the night us anything about and the other in the group had right there 's also like the confirmation , <unk> to know , ok , it 's now just <unk> hour , that 's got me they then told .
or i did you what very different now do n't even by the mountain telling .
and so that to know , it 's anybody else there , the it may also just bad about <unk> about , we might even talked -- there are all we <unk> hour , the sun 's going on .
what these things , this is even mirrors from the outside can trust and significantly increase and can just to contribute , you so the personal gold medal 's also done .
and for me is trust of all then given and is particularly then perfect , if you just like the personal gold medal and that what 's really do want , then eventually , in the notion right there .
of course it right , in the exercise with the gold , in that you like <unk> -- do i actually not too , why it let 's making -- maybe , do n't know , in the value to try or to look , whether it 's just lead very is ?
so i believe that one , at some medals it 's so , in vancouver that were six hundred of hard .
if all that real gold would be , then <unk> i do n't here , then if i was on the <unk> , get me .

but as i said , i believe that one , the real , why you that does is more , you , you can imagine : what did i actually 've been created and how have my skills and forces focused on a point .
how did i in me in my skills , but obviously in the team that we all need , care whether in studying , in the job in which one thing , whatever .
anyway , whether old man or young woman , we just people , even in the we trust can .
and if we then this goal in the head clear before have eyes and this also have achieved , then that is the best proof that we at least in a project in our lives trust could .
and if you 's one can , you 's also , definitely in other areas .
thank you
a science for me , this is the title of my talk , the 's happened is to <unk> your nice maps .
what i tick , is that the very <unk> <unk> , the sciences , as something <unk> in the general population to <unk> .
in basically , i could get happy to be .
if i in a <unk> <unk> , there 's all <unk> just with literature to scientific stories , the <unk> <unk> is .
even any <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where science stories , <unk> stories , somehow get across time to .
every television has at least a <unk> , where some scientific issues processed to .
itself , that 's totally <unk> , if you look , what it in magazines and <unk> for children there with the issues .
every program has somehow , for a own a spin-off of the <unk> , and yet it 's such a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing that the can i 'm like to see , that can i 'd like reading , but that that 's 'm not themselves .
cool , is cool science just sort of on csi , at <unk> bath , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , <unk> ?
on csi such a <unk> five minutes , has nothing at with the reality to do , but that 's cool , <unk> ?
there , because i can to identify .
big bang equivalent <unk> , because i can get a laugh , i understand the jokes n't , but it 's fine .
this is extremely too bad .
because , that 's kind of a little bit counterintuitive , the the future we 'll just manage can with these technological issues and themes .
but at bay that no one for themselves off .
i have some little examples of time <unk> , like science , or science just us in such a <unk> have .
it 's a <unk> example , in london , you have a beautiful tower being built , <unk> , the architect , let 's not so now , we build this time something like this <unk> .
what happened , right now , the sunlight from up in the facade falls , i did this time <unk> well , and just focus and , somewhere in the other you at a point <unk> .
this went up by the press , there was actually just a jaguar .
so sad , the heat it 's so <unk> , that this poor <unk> , the really long , long saved has , there are the <unk> <unk> .
and ask you to , such an architect , has the n't actually sort of times as a bit of what in physics learned that i mean is yes completely new , that such a mirror stuff just focus .
so what i 've found , very new , is <unk> , sort of <unk> before christ , where it walk with rays a fleet sank , did .
there question i really , which has more of the design or an architect , or where he have studied ?
now this is a very <unk> example .
a classic , which <unk> of that are things have is that , the <unk> .
<unk> , that 's already now a few years ago , as it 's just sort of in the media got .
there was the train has been freaky , because <unk> changed plants , that was at once a danger .
genes , asks with green <unk> .
genes been sort of what bad outcome .
<unk> , oh , there are gene inside .
there 's situations where in the market farmers really gotten have : hey , i 've <unk> vegetables .
no idea what it should be , yes .
so , yes , okay , dutch tomatoes , we can get a way .
but to the time i was in the lab , active in and was eventually , frustrated , because i tried , these evil genes in my bacterial <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came home , and my then neighbor , <unk> , you see but not happy , in which is because this ?
i like this : yeah , i try there for three days as a little gene in my bacteria to transform and that work at all .
this was that what i tried , to to explain , so kind of a <unk> , genetics , i thought , yes , there is the good old lady , if i of genes speaking , do you 've been , what she says .
this was that what i actually meant , so one particular sequence , i there in this <unk> <unk> get to .
but that was that what the woman perceived has .
this woman has i never again the hand 's .
who knows that i do you <unk> , <unk> ?
genes is what 's bad outcome .
now that 's been good for 10 years ago , and yet it 's kind of in consciousness grounded .
genes , that 's be doing what bad outcome .
<unk> i have very long not more read .
it 's then the gene technology free and it has but really in our language permeated thought .
<unk> want to europe , was a headline .
all genetically altered is a lot of other corn , of itâ€™s actually not genes contains .
a different headline , all genetically altered it rats to die .
yes , it was also a beautiful <unk> .
that are but not that old and it 's also quite anyway , on the level i 'm be ways .
anyway , whether the time or the picture , all talk from all genetically altered .
fortunately , it 's not yet <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm afraid , it continues , not more time .
but this is simply , which insecurity in the population is , because it and just not to the subjects who .
equal parts we have in our future us with these technologies are .
now was just <unk> , none had the big on the theme , but there are about things are and elected , what the most really no idea have .
and it 's pretty sad .
how is actually do this information of the lab in the population ?
if we we assume , this small , boy , motivated scientist is sitting in his lab , has an experiment , <unk> anything , beautiful and well , and he drops think , the man , that is something , which , that interested in the public .
then got to the first of the professor go .
the head , of deciding then , okay , really cool topic , you 'll get his name on it as first author , that 's always important in science , first author be .
good idea , i 'm still , not in public , it goes to a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> think , oh , great idea , class , there 's make issue a press <unk> .
<unk> , here we issue a press with a project , a nice idea , and that comes and somehow get out of the <unk> .
this is then <unk> , yes , but at who are really ?
now are these institute rarely alone , usually have multiple <unk> such a common substrate , a common <unk> .
and of all these are then the <unk> , the really cool projects , will then over the <unk> at the magazine , given , at the <unk> , no matter whether it leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> are .
this is the way .
of the basis it will always going to successfully filtered , in <unk> up until the really , really cool experiments , then the really to speak of projects , there in this <unk> come up .
this is that single give magazine , they 're really well done , there 's of all there 's free , yes , but who <unk> i that ?
in basically , just the , and interested in it .
in the <unk> we call it be the <unk> the <unk> .
so that , and anyway , really interested in it , who feeds then still the newspaper , yes , beautiful and good .
the magazine , reached the audience , the , and interested in it , and might about an idea have , where <unk> it 's even in these articles .
and who <unk> ' i so but really ?
the <unk> , the that it anyway about .
the uh-uh , that was now , yeah , the otto <unk> , i call it 's lord <unk> <unk> , of the circumstances another one read , i tried , it neutral to hold , the <unk> i it did n't really .
anyway , again , our future we 'll just sort of coming can , if we us with these <unk> engage .
fracking , <unk> , renewable energy , <unk> , that 's all stories , the <unk> are , the lord <unk> but not really understand and and over the he sort of going to .
my project , my idea is therefore , in other piece , these small young , motivated scientists come out of the <unk> to take , really completely from its regular <unk> to separate , and it 's a course to give , a seminar , you science understandable communicates .

once it the mouth <unk> and over his career telling , it 's <unk> .
<unk> , they are scientists , the tell you a what of <unk> .
<unk> , listen to chemically on , <unk> , chemically is it almost like that same level like genes .
chemically treated , this is somehow , oh , you do n't know , which there is .
the really teach , watch out time on , that 's nice and good if you on a conference are and there your people , your <unk> , on <unk> anything you want to go , then you 'd like of <unk> tell , but bleeding , another time , say , just add some water .
where is the problem , it really <unk> and normal to talk ?
i school and so , that 's my idea , these young scientist , that have not so far in the hierarchy <unk> are , that have a little malleable are , the school i , you get across throw away .
that has for all a use , <unk> , like , whatever , investors , want the also know what 's in the <unk> happens .
eventually they that , tax , of the there are used , so the need to actually also the <unk> communicate .
but the these training , that 's just a story .
i want to then they also really , a jury did n't sit and the supposed to your project ourselves , your project a jury , were , <unk> , frankly , worse it goes not , children .
it 's a quote , i do n't know , whether it 's real , of albert einstein , if you do it not just explain you can , then you do it does n't really understood .
so , the scientists of the lab to take and your project really to rethink , how do i really that normally they communicate ?
so storytelling is it already several .
<unk> are totally buck rogers , is everywhere , in on every college , common , but there also <unk> i in basically , just over the <unk> .
who 's because for <unk> end of the city in the university at some sunday morning , puts out there a talk to <unk> <unk> off ?
this is the , that it anyway about .
and i again , my <unk> .
so , they are the people , and anyway interested in it , that there , and , there of those talks back .
that 's beautiful , there are any <unk> done , all are satisfied , is everyone happy , driving home to and that 's it .
so i 'm still on a second thing , to say , there is not at this <unk> the project .
these scientists are also been trained , how are wired well actually children ?
because many really unlearned have , and on the essential to reduce .
because scientists , like the research , and how children their world explore , is identical .
children are working really extremely scientifically .
they do anything like learn the walk .
they try , what does that ?
<unk> , falling down , no way , does n't work , next iteration , i change a couple of parameters , make it 's time soon .
children learn extremely scientifically .
that 's really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> , what happens , which factors i to change , it works or not .
this is normal .
but that have a lot unlearned .
and of so i think , really can work that just so after the <unk> , and those scientists permanently in the neighborhood , in the environment with the kids of kindergarten , from the elementary school , there in experiments are the kids , on their <unk> , and , there really to go away , because i convinced me , the children and the scientists are actually in basically , the same language talk .
and then you may , maybe some point , that 's so my hope , tell the children and then also to home , and then <unk> i also , mr. <unk> , the and then also on one time for scientific are interested , because the children him that tell .
and then is not anywhere in the newspaper , that 's not anywhere , galileo , but his children tell him something that it <unk> done with a <unk> worked has , it 's a bread <unk> has , that there paper <unk> has , and understand then , and shaking you may also the head , as an architect 's a house can build .
and not just <unk> i then , mr. <unk> , but also the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately <unk> it is still remember that the first <unk> , i call have , have said , yes , no way , so , <unk> for our scientists , that this is just not subject , they 're other priorities .
a scientist has not like i can communicate .
yes , i think i then , okay , and calls i the next to .
but who somehow in a department works , <unk> is in a company , like , whatever , there in the next stop .
thank you .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
can fly you also not every day .
the last few weeks were terrible .
the weather 's got us a big is : by the bill did .
in seven , going to eight years , i 'm asking been , if i here 's take me .
i was first ceo , almost 10 years , the <unk> <unk> in munich , in <unk> .
we 're there are right way to the top has come .
had <unk> as a client .
and for me it was actually rather , well , that is something <unk> .
what is it really ?
<unk> , that 's actually completely ridiculous .
i was then , but 've learned how that is and so i stand here today .
and well maybe it 's a little bit crazy , but it 's on any case , too high , emotionally .
it 's nice and always exciting and makes great fun .
and i 'm going to you just in the next <unk> , <unk> minutes a little bit of this life of <unk> tell .
i 'm ceos in <unk> .
the company that we have been a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm ceo of <unk> .
this company we have been 20 years .
and ceo of <unk> .
the company that we have been about <unk> or <unk> years .
that runs the <unk> here at <unk> .
<unk> .
it a picture that i show you want , the little thing right , that 's actually like a red , such a <unk> on it , or anything , do n't know , there is exactly this point is still too big .
so there is the only <unk> <unk> .
and it 's actually just now , another 10 active .
this is already what .
it 's about 20 thousand active global <unk> .
so that 's really did n't a market .
this is not just a when .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also , why do you and then actually ?
how does this place ?
<unk> in valid and only 10 active , because we can afterwards , even talk about why this is so .
very quickly the history .
<unk> has a of many of crazy <unk> <unk> the <unk> here started .
very short soon-to-be-demolished .
has to <unk> 14 of the first world around <unk> <unk> into life started .
and then they were in the first world war , <unk> <unk> died actually <unk> and <unk> , have been around <unk> <unk> built for <unk> .
the , and london bombarded by and so forth and so forth .

so that 's the story because in <unk> .
and we had an insane campaign .
but <unk> , the client , was n't quite enjoyed , because he suddenly realized 's gone , which there , and that really stuck , which old memory in there 'd put .
and you know that was hold for the marketing people of a critically .
but nevertheless , it was in london a great campaign for the weather in north up there was many years has been very bad and very <unk> .
and we 're not very much went .
then has <unk> two decades , <unk> 21 hugo <unk> this has paid .
and has a <unk> seeing , and then to america and was .
that has a myth that things , that all the german nation basically again , something felt has , as which is <unk> and <unk> that airship hijacked by .
there was the then in new york , receiving with <unk> .
and all the german nation 's got up , <unk> , we 're back , who .
this is in all <unk> so inside and this is really that tells a bit of these myth that by this thing .
but actually are then to <unk> and <unk> just five , six , seven <unk> even still were built and actually just two really big , the <unk> <unk> and the hindenburg , the passengers carries have .
passengers , a hundred , where there <unk> passengers and <unk> it was the end <unk> <unk> .
but it was a myth .
and the <unk> and then was the first live <unk> crash with there , unfortunately , yes <unk> .
next to the titanic that event that time , where a one icon , a a product <unk> is and then also never more and flight .
that , the other machines were at .
and <unk> , <unk> the last just existing <unk> destroyed .
the the the materials used for <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> mined .
then was for nothing about <unk> years .
and then the had the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , the that had the idea , maybe you should that back to start .
and i was hired <unk> , because you is technically a brilliant product has evolved , we come in that , but the market .
yes is he actually a market ?
what 's because actually this ?
so .
talk about that we now .
the <unk> <unk> , this is perhaps , quickly to illustrate , we ham , in time it 's still , <unk> , people have a lot of done .
you have many companies , the from this <unk> came out of these are .
there are today <unk> collaborators , around 20 billion sales .
it 's a real <unk> , to the profitable .
there 's a lot behind .
that have me then also believe , get here to come .
the <unk> at it 's actually a normal plane as any other plane as well , but has , sorry , has very a gas , helium n't hydrogen , and very also a <unk> with <unk> .
is like a whale , of the water on and below there , and since the <unk> do have to .
the time now is n't there , that in detail to explain .
in this is a <unk> this in , with a structure .
it 's two types of <unk> .
it 's rigid <unk> , that we are , <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
that have within a structure and they are sort of how balloons in <unk> .
this is the most <unk> , the in the world been built these are , about four , five hundred piece .
and of that there 's only today , as i said earlier , all we <unk> in was negative our own was , so there 's just have two decades .
this is what then the production out when an envelope raised will .
the left the structure , think again .
and the shell is also <unk> .
comes from the <unk> .
origins , the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the origins .
it one point two million dollars as a shell .
and 's got to <unk> be , to <unk> be and making a <unk> be , because over again , you have you look , when times a broke away in there would be or a hole , that it 's not going to tear it .
there are doing the <unk> again <unk> do and look right , whether it 's going on holes are controlled .
and the end looks a blimp and without grow so out how it 's there .
the <unk> is so technically a <unk> product
and that you look down here at the numbers , very short time .

that 's very very little and very very good .
this is a <unk> .
that can to see .
but there 's a different trend , of us right now about power and the have i up here there .

and this year in may we were at <unk> percent .
if you the eight years , my eight years , at <unk> <unk> and <unk> from this thing to , then you can say at least in these eight years ago , obviously a <unk> the <unk> , even know , in these eight years ago that has weather clearly changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can there passengers , not from this fog fly .
want the itâ€™s something see .
and the the <unk> or <unk> up nearly every year and in .
so a little <unk> of , our weather is not just felt , but as well statistically , because we do weather every day , changes .
but because that is so , this is now this well , has the european union a program <unk> <unk> to do , almost 10 million dollars and we 're an essential to part of this program .
i come today morning just from finland .
this airship here is equipped , is a flying lab become .
<unk> called the campaign .


and the <unk> t flies by italy , to get up to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
over many many hundreds <unk> measures of and analysis of the air like the to chemically , as you react to our things that we the soil do .
there , so i 've just explain , up there are we just with the other airship .
a great a great assignment .
and is if you like to have derived from the theme weather .
it 's so very good .
and there are still have a few <unk> .
this airship on sweden last week or <unk> week .
and in finland is actually the weather super , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the <unk> say something that they had never even .
i did i 've got there just wonderful , beautiful warm days experienced .
the mosquitos , then also did n't that bad .
we were also in africa .
and have to de <unk> as <unk> diamond looking , better said volcanoes looking , the connected underground are , who wear away are by erosion of million years .
just you can you also ask , is that 's all africa , that then a go through when you to make sense of questions , after an idea questions , to make sense of questions is it makes sense if at the theater at the film <unk> or <unk> diamond 's gone is .
and i 'm just wondered , you know what we do there really ?
and what support we there really ?
the end , we were after two years and also done .
the 184 was then also not on .
the whole <unk> came back <unk> and that was then finished .
and a tornado , the <unk> at the mast , and then that damaged , that he also in the bottom be able .
was but not bad .
we were there 's good insurance industries and were actually quite pleased .
because this the prototype .
and i did n't really what i do with this was .
yes , what we now do , a very brief <unk> from the from the <unk> .
what we now do , it 's what you know , and it 's about complexity , it 's going to questions , growth or she insisted .
what we now let 's the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do <unk> of course .
we we need to the <unk> always get there .
<unk> is aging .
there are , and also devices in , after 10 , fifteen , again , the be replaced need .
we replace just the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with the clients <unk> talk about that we still .
we do we need to the <unk> constantly doing .
we 're a <unk> <unk> operating , the of the germans <unk> and of the european watch control is , and to and seeing , with <unk> like <unk> , or as well as an airbus .
this is also <unk> and costs money and must always on also get to .
the question is , makes you actually on ?
you want to evolve ?
you make greater <unk> ?
it 's <unk> , unmanned slaughter <unk> .
what you do there really ?
you go further in the market ?
you go further in the operating ?
and that we 've obviously in my time , attempted .
and here we also some <unk> suffered .
how actually also the <unk> <unk> some <unk> suffered , and several-fold bust was .
the beginning to the <unk> stood still the donating of <unk> .
the population the german population has it was saved with six million <unk> as donating , as the fourth airship <unk> was and he basically bust was , has the population it a donating done .
and it 's at all of <unk> <unk> <unk> and the other companies were otherwise , we were or <unk> i today anyway not here , and other companies are not be there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear past , in san francisco to a customer .
and put a very <unk> investor .
both of projects are actually failed .
so even <unk> .
simultaneously , we <unk> won .
and i not a picture that , because we that <unk> <unk> not yet can show .
but just in america is now the <unk> of the first <unk> in the ready to .
we have three of sells .
with <unk> that we like a with a partner that , the technique again .
and that 's a huge success , but at the defeat you know .
two customers are basically <unk> been , because it does n't go .
why it was not ?
we know it actually have .
either was the 'm not the right or the passengers had to go far <unk> or in america 's knew you <unk> the last 30 forty years , the commercials have done .
the ham people have <unk> , have this airship seen , have said , <unk> , again a , again a <unk> , the power of ads .
there can that did n't really , you there <unk> can .
and it was actually , twice as hard in marketing and over to get them : hey , guys says , and fly .
<unk> goes well .
the pilot into the year , transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year we just <unk> done because of weather .
there are then the same time a half million .
and then is bad .
the <unk> going <unk> routes here .
it 's the point , of course is beautiful , if i also when ceos and look like the passengers get out and and and all laughing and we basically the also do n't do advertising , because this mouth to speak about and over again , we about <unk> sold coupon , and people say , this is so beautiful , and recommend it your friends , which and who also the further , in the family .
and we 're great booking .
whereas , i clean up to with the fault , that you think we 're <unk> .
you could still , more flights to do .
we have such a <unk> at <unk> and we were <unk> .
it is actually also not quite .
we do , advertising .

and audi has done that here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a difficult market .
and you have , sometimes even the <unk> imagine : do advertising , meaning ?
we have itâ€™s really enough ads , but internet has many changes , the <unk> about the beginning saying , because the <unk> all of control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , so we have today just another 10 active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one put this , <unk> , three has <unk> bought , 10 are active .
so they are then six of 10 .
that means we 're then the market in fact , even if one is to control .
and hope , it also again a future thing to do .

so <unk> 's nice .
do advertising we also find beautiful .
only we find any customers .
<unk> to do we find great , has a technological value .
here we customers .
this is not slowly .
it 's <unk> , goes on and down .
so one such a <unk> takes years to you the get .
and then there , it again years no .
there is it too funny effect , the easy for and hard to control are .
in any case is that the situation , <unk> , a point in the market , so actually not a market .
yet we go on .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power to do it .
they put the only just the question : in what form we do it on ?
how much money we give in the market ?
what do what we do for this ?
in what form this is to run by going ?
and i personally , they have me also asked , a personal to say , i 'm going to my history <unk> , where where i <unk> <unk> wanted , back against the big <unk> , also <unk> has this little <unk> dead so , you want , it 's also here to rescue .
i was also again , greenpeace three years <unk> now , in vancouver island threats , and this whole <unk> forest 've seen , i was like this <unk> , that i 'm there was doing now .
and then there was a <unk> about greenpeace , in the money though , and did n't know what they do with this should and almost about to actually gone are .
there you to employ those , in the way to <unk> .
and i have three years for greenpeace into a <unk> and now i do it in the hope , a long future in <unk> to do .
zero , is that right ? forty seconds , i 'm still done , thanks .
<unk>
yes , thank you .
this is my three points , i in the <unk> minutes talking to .

how we come to soulfulness .
and especially , what do ?
so what is there 's really ?
we start with our first thing .
the first part is perhaps a little depressing .
but it 's also drum , the challenges to show .
in a few years about , that even harder been , this sort of to explain .
that we 're a problem have today , know every child .
that we environmental problems have .
but it worth it always been over time to suggest , that are the challenges that population growth for example .
all kinds of <unk> is exponentially growing up .
if you it 's in a whole long term , looking the oil use could for example , then it 's a very short episode in history have to be .
now in ca n't we imagine that it sort of different is , when that oil use could be back to go up .
you know the climate change , last <unk> years .
some people say , well , once there 's time , which , so let 's the last <unk> years of .
that you can also <unk> look , <unk> ' i also , right .
and you can say , who needs because it ?
and you can say the ocean is far away .
but it 's then on now , and when you a little deeper into practice on it in , sort of real grand challenges , in things that it really to avoid being , otherwise we 've just trouble with the <unk> , the health .
<unk> it is there days over 30 degrees .
and because it goes degrees ' in our cities like in vienna , or <unk> , and increasingly more of bad .
it 's but also to the <unk> , especially in asia .
think of the himalayas , where the big streams that is how and the <unk> of them on that there with water from the himalayas is coming .
it 's last end not for the planet .
the planet is that <unk> , what we do , because there 's been much larger crisis .
and <unk> , but it 's about us to the people that sort of in in a type may very uncomfortable live .
it 's about loss of biodiversity .
the deserts , from it .
the freshwater back to be less .
this is the aral sea , where an essential to part of cotton from ?
and it all , where that come from ?
all these bad things , say , i time , stuck in the one or another form with the global <unk> together .
with the , what we all of the earth up , what we harvest .
not just , the the oil and the metals and the minerals , but also the renewables commodities are in renewable powered , but over the scarce .
and we should just look , we so little as possible of waste , and also last end of waste and emissions to produce .
so it 's why is , in the <unk> said already been the entire <unk> really dramatically to reduce .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not just c o two , <unk> of a car on a different but really differently to live .
the way you economies .
our engineering completely new to change .
if we still a quick look back the hunters and gatherers , and there are still going on earth societies , the in principle that life , come with a ton resources in the year per person and year from .
in a <unk> it was then in the longest time of human history three to five tons .
today is it fifteen to <unk> .
so <unk> has to that <unk> .
and he 's very , very unequally distributed on earth .
it 's in north america even more than with us with us even more than for the earth unsustainable is .
and in other parts of the world , you look in africa very , very much less .
and to come , we there are the effects with us , the rivers , the air is much better have gotten into the last decades but it 's basically the remember that we that in other parts of the world shift have .
and the other parts of the world 's so , but still less like .
and therefore are also the conflict , that we see from , ukraine , is , afghanistan , where whatever you look at them on the <unk> of american geological survey and then you see , where the resources from .
and this is there is it 's very colorful , which is , you have many materials there , where the <unk> the world .
so if we to clean up to , then we need to us with the theme deal .
so we need to change , the ecological limits are everywhere , the <unk> is everywhere .
and that what we there on <unk> life , is not so <unk> .
that has been of mahatma gandhi up when he has said , the world has enough for everybody 's needs , but not for everybody 's greed .
and there we , like here we the average life has been much about it .
so .
this was the sort of <unk> part .
but i 'm always , you the needs , to understand it worth it also what to change .
even if i there would say , it worth it also like it is so , the way you live , which is more soulfulness .
but it is n't always , sort of , from the <unk> <unk> you need but a law , say , i time .
so , which is actually soulfulness .
and since we need to find that we in our can share the world that as much have reached economically , socially acceptable to quality , on standard , us in the average often do n't feel .
here 's a pretty bad mood , but there are people , and you know exactly sure , people that does not so good can deal with this story .
i have time and there .
<unk> and climate change have the same cause .
we work too much and the intensity .
this is on the one hand we get yourself in stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i 'm also very happy to .
and on the other side are we just this <unk> .
what but then is a good life ?
how we can that defines what ?
now comes in a a little scientific <unk> .
and what the first time i 've said , and what i later tell me is scientific sort of <unk> , but this is it 's about it 's drum , as i can this sort of the first time , defined ?
and there 's important , to understand life has always two aspects .
life has the aspect of an objective conditions as it to go , what i to eat have .
i was a roof over the head ?
i was friends ?
i was relationship , i can in life participate ?
but 's also , how does it to me with how do , i myself to manage it ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes the <unk> quality .
and then <unk> ' i two words this , the at the place where matter .
one is the needs .
the needs that are quite fundamental dimension of our human development , our there 's 's drum , and feelings .
if we our needs satisfy can , then we 're happy .
and needs , you ca n't say , needs are being or not sustainable .
needs by se 're not yet , for <unk> .
what 's needs ?
you can a scientist quote , i 'm here just two called .
and there you course the physical needs , but also need for safety , and social relations .
for protection , for participation , after <unk> , for creativity , to spirituality , for freedom .
all that has a bit of what do with money to .
but to a large part of just really did n't , but the question is how can i me that in my life set up .
and there i am at the other important term .
the strategy .
the strategy , i 'm using the available to me is to me this needs to meet .
and because it goes then a drum , that i can sort of with a high <unk> or with a low <unk> do .
because i can much money need or some money need .
strategies are you saw my behavior as i 'm my needs <unk> .
that has with my values to do , with the resources , with the ways that the i have .
if i of money , 'll ' i different from my needs to try , to satisfy as if i sort of money on the bank account have .
it 's first to the <unk> , this is the roof over the head , to eat , and then you to the <unk> .
and here it goes then you , that can with much or little <unk> , that can sort of being or <unk> be .
and if we all the strategies , the available to me standing in my needs to satisfy , <unk> then we talk from a lifestyle .
so .
this was the sort of scientific <unk> .
and now it goes you what we can do now ?
how it goes like about this ?
and there simply just some clues .
obviously has to this sort of , everybody for to myself out .
but the evidence on the individual way on a technological way , here is to get ' i , a lot also about technology which had been and then also on a political way .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what we do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides at first have sort of words , the danger is that we were at the more affluence and more resources , they consume .
last end the quality of back down because that , the effects and ugly will , sort of , and on us last end back hit to .
or , whether we do it , so there in some other direction go , the with less <unk> , maybe even with less consumption but with a higher quality of that are connected .
because there 's one of my <unk> , may recognize him , some <unk> of <unk> of this topic <unk> , so more lives with less <unk> .
because it goes much about technology like i can each one thing that here we use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee the car , the traffic , how do i like this out ?
cement , i can now you produce , i can the house of wood building , etc. etc .
in order to significantly less <unk> more or the same life to create .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> that , so words , the <unk> per <unk> , and since we 're at the , which also now here has been been talking about 's been , because it goes very deep going on it 's companies to look .
where are actually the needs ?
that services , i can really satisfy ?
and how do i that to be slightly <unk> do ?
and not with a little less but with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent less .
there 's many examples of the that you 've been able .
in vienna is to a building be built with two decades <unk> .
with seven <unk> it is in <unk> already built .
this in essence of wood has something .
that you , if you maybe it in fifty years no longer need by can and then again in its parts and not so , so you very much less resources consumed with everything else , you get there of in the moment with half of and the goal is with a fifth of <unk> , over the whole lifetime of the house designed with this fifth of <unk> long out .
it 's but also a lot in our own , sort of how <unk> ' i 'm really ?
sebastian <unk> has a beautiful book written , <unk> .
where he shows how difficult it last end is sort of really from the from the sort of this <unk> come out .
the <unk> , i want me , apart the others come after , and then i 'm sort of goes in this in this race in .
you yourself , you 're , that i was very satisfied , and then you look , i the new .
at the nicest <unk> ' i the <unk> , that you know it all .
when i my department founded was of years ago , we have letter writing .
then you were waiting able to the letter back now <unk> ' i just an email , is just <unk> <unk> .
it <unk> ' i hundreds of email .
and i can very much longer afford .
this is productivity , which is the economic growth , we 'll just about it back .
but i did n't really time saved .
i 've got to me with a failure done .
but it good examples , slow food for instance where i really sort of the claim the quality and the one of <unk> in the foreground spot .
and with a small <unk> more life can do .
one of my favorite examples is <unk> .
it 's best-selling , now , you take , that just average person with us in germany , austria about 10 thousand things in the home has .
you can just start to count .
who , two , three generations 10 thousand things had , had employees , computing .
that have to the manage .
we need to himself with <unk> .
and and fewer people come to know , with these all options .
and need a guides to raising us , and helps us , and <unk> with those few things <unk> .
if only ' get ' i interesting , is perhaps even more just use of the spacecraft 's going to , get ' , i also have 10,000 from things .
the next example is use instead own .
a true boom .
star , <unk> , <unk> it 's sort of maybe about 20 years of in in alternative spinning been developed .
in the meantime , using it always more people , if you to <unk> thinking .
if you to <unk> thinking .
platforms , business models that just to work , how do you the things that we already have these beautiful <unk> here , the front of a few hundred years ago was built still , you use and just about the other centuries of using this is it last end .
that which even invested was just better to use .
this is the last end , a question of justice .
i 've showed you before you how profoundly unequal that 's take them as the picture between africa and europe and a a <unk> world .
you like that all the same with these resources economy can 's only then possible if we can use less .
and that is just not less quality , because many of us has been to kind of a lot have .
but it 's an important task of economics , the businesses , these products , these are really apply to imagine that we need , for us a good life to do with a much less resources .
last point , that has also something with the big public policy to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> ' i that .
if you a little attention that for reading , it 's 've been back of oecd , <unk> , and now <unk> every week are these predictions , back down <unk> .
it says , yes , a crisis is before the door to my view , and after the , what we were very much with economists have been talking and so busy have , there are the numbers of austria , you find that basically for all countries growth going to just after the bottom .
and there 's no reason for growth to have , so , as i do this from my adolescence , from the sixties years know .
for part that , in math reasons .
one point five percent growth is now as much like eight percent growth of fifty years .
and that eight percent is that , what china today .
that are also about there , where we may , fifty years were .
overall , if the pie bigger is , course is harder for times eight percent <unk> .
the one percent is still much , so we 'll be good living .
but you have to you put up , this is , not even if we zero percent growth would have , would be that yes , the next year precisely that kind of producing and consume and incomes , like in this year .
that we can be good invest and so we can work .
this is also why does not so powerfully wrong , because you these statistics you know , the show that growth on a long , not more with the quality of life combined .
the economy grows , but the quality of stays in in are countries like on the state , on the we are .
and actually also jobs are even without growth happen and it 's really not so closely , together , like that 's going back of <unk> and you all say you will .
it is just not and then you have to also time with the economy deal .
and it comes over again , and more and more , that , too <unk> like format , or next week , get ' i , in the coming in the trend , a larger story with that start on , through .
now , <unk> has the edward <unk> , the then-director nobel prize in his <unk> so <unk> , he has said , the good life the good business , the good economy <unk> <unk> the good life .
so it goes past finally , and not to not primarily about the returns to create , not primarily about growth to create what to our countries do n't even more about .
for border , and these countries , and for china , for india there is that just completely different story .
and that 's going to just then as well under <unk> , if we there were still growing let and we just sort of on this level , on this high level , on the we 're good to live and economies .
and it 's also policy .
it takes goals .
it takes the indicators , say the economists .
it does n't just sort of the growth , but we should really look and measure and wondering how it 's actually with the quality , rises in the ?
is the down ?
and also our politicians measure .
of course , what 's the <unk> ?
how does that sort of together ?
we need an essence of this is the <unk> to finally put and not the work .
who of them in entrepreneurs that among them , but also the worker , know that very good .
what kind of control walk away , we know the real time a colleague paid has .
that you could really do differently .
the resources are some sort of reduces and so among the resources <unk> and not the work .
and you 've got last end all <unk> bring about engagement to create , in <unk> to save them , health , infrastructure without growth .
this is , but there you have to sort of a little harder .
this is , bottom , more or less , on all levels can in this way worked be , we can take too hard , we can as businesses the right products , services as a consumer sort of us to ask what we need in fact , how do we that what 's sort of good for us ?
what we need and what we need not be ?
the right politics vote , the framework put them .
a couple of evidence i 've been .
and finally , that , the science <unk> percent of <unk> 's still in the way , how we can the growth drive ?
, but unfortunately , not done .
if you the projections look at if you the development look at the last 20 years , it 's going to down because it 's not about .
the politics does n't and the <unk> not going to growth create , but this is the question how we do with the order , and it 's like that we a good life of that have ?
so , <unk> 's do it .
be the <unk> you <unk> to lake .
with heart , brain , hand and finally , the <unk> we 'll have to .
thank you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this town .
this city has so many stories to tell .
one of it 's on the a few hundred years happened .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
on this creative problem-solving i get right , and on the story bit later .
they will have to do with the fortress <unk> .
this is just <unk> here , in the middle of this city is , and lots of this city , which is and as indeed .
a different story before .

a man will notice , like on once in his shoes that 's get that it right <unk> .
that to him 's warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that 's not so with the heat .
he 's so one he pulls the shoe of put a knife <unk> not too long is going in , and it 's several times makes there a lot of holes in .
he pulls the shoe back on this is being knife way and notice he has a new climate in shoe .

and this number , that you see here is the point in the forbes list of ' at the morton <unk> is today .
a business is <unk> formed , with four letters .
the one or other of you know it .
he 's the original idea , nike and <unk> offered .
both have died .
so he says , well , <unk> , i 'll take my own business .
<unk> 's it at the stock market .
doing now several thousand employees in just three hundred business in about <unk> countries the world .
so much for this creative problem-solving .
why not something new to invent what we have n't there is ?
and mario has to maybe the question put the , with <unk> forces you .
if you <unk> have n't know , it stands for which is that an opportunity ?
this question that has i 've often work , in difficult situations .
if something gone wrong is or my collaborator <unk> me or engineering n't work or what also the .
<unk> , little memory , <unk> .
what it 's an opportunity ?
and now , you get from <unk> into <unk> .
what the difference can <unk> ' i with this example here <unk> .
and one another example , from the franc <unk> now , and the ones <unk> us from <unk> .
and the evidence , like creative people can be , if it about their own insurance does .
i want you some examples here show .
that are so actually so , at the franc <unk> and that has it also a <unk> done .
i <unk> ' the amazing .
my son has the woman does n't <unk> .
he 's just <unk> , it is the wife by the <unk> <unk> .
or i had the day plants <unk> when i the intersection achieved , grew up a sudden a bush into my vision and i could the other vehicles not see .
very clearly , who 's doing is , right ?
the boonies .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> been and two times nearly died .
because they can me , at least that half <unk> big payoff .
the last thing i was at the crash n't blame .
blame was the young woman in <unk> .
if you 're a man , is a another explanation obsolete .
if you but a woman who are , they get it 'll do n't .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish me and i dream of them , we all more of that creativity use .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and that does not be like this .
why do things just a do differently ?
old things that we do , the to that has become are , that we might be bored , or <unk> , as opposite .
why the not just a do differently , that <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there is it so <unk> companies that using this .
for example <unk> , they but these <unk> of their run by standing , these signs , or on the wall , for example , and there is then maybe that what it on .
also a way , right ?
let 's the coffee to stay instead , for <unk> .
or what .
we did n't available -- , <unk> you .
is itâ€™s already today <unk> , right ?
if you the mobile phone not something type can .
or eat them with me , otherwise starve we both .
what , but creative .
so something needs it .
i about ' one of the client or an the then <unk> would and say , okay , that i like .
this <unk> ' i out .
a german prison <unk> has in the <unk> the current <unk> <unk> , and it in <unk> .
once the sport , the current news , one policy .
if you there three times on the <unk> was , is you <unk> .
even got the the complaint about long to <unk> the food .
it 's a <unk> building and this restaurant very small , so had the chefs all of hands of to .
it was to intimately .
that have thought , collectively , what we do ?
how do we the problem ?
we can not faster be in the kitchen .
this idea is born .
in any table is a <unk> <unk> <unk> set fresh olive oil salt , pepper , and a <unk> .
so , that the an in the <unk> on it eat their <unk> here has been ourselves <unk> could .
just a different .
a creative idea , and maybe even with the <unk> solved .
it 's a person the power is currently not just popular .
you that person is the leader of <unk> , so the <unk> the <unk> .
and now <unk> itâ€™s the german trajectory .
already the second day , it takes a monday , so four days .
a company has <unk> <unk> to the staff of the month elected , and you know may already , which .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , we thank you .
the people come to us to consider doing <unk> .
the buses are packed , it 's <unk> run , people together , in match because each of course , other because of looking , of a to b to come .
but why not just too much a little use and creatively from his disadvantage do something ?
sometimes has happened , creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> may be out how about this company that you may know .
so we have you know , there are at the <unk> n't really goes well , but that it at the <unk> also been too must is n't something <unk> .
or at <unk> in the car .
you know , we the different , <unk> , and all possible directions .
yes .
why not on a piece bacon in the car on , if you <unk> 's what ?
or at <unk> there 's also ways that the creative to shape .
and all that has to do just with humor , with happiness with , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son with me in office .
and sitting on this <unk> before me .
so , we have multiple <unk> around the <unk> .
and then he turns from left , and he 's delight , and i in my down on <unk> well , to the you , listen to , well that 's not a playground here .
he to me , look at me , big eyes and yet , playground .
and in the moment <unk> ' i 'm actually he 's right , right ?
why is that not a playground ?
why is that , what we do , not the playground for grown-ups ?
that if only , but much go through , right ?
if we sort are , if we our talents to use this to do what we like to do .
and so <unk> outcomes , but it 's sort .
this curious phenomena is that when a particular day of the week is coming then it changes what in our brains .
it 's the first day in the week somehow , is our focus on another day .
so one other day , we usually prefer to .
so into the weekend .
that you 're listening , as well in the media .
at <unk> is yes , really , just a day until the weekend .
or if then the most beautiful time of the year announced it , the vacation .
what are then the rest of <unk> weeks of the year ?
it 's so awful ?
we 've all so awful jobs ?
a <unk> it had time on it gave , this topic .
yes , monday can ' i and the rest life you ask ourselves .
or on <unk> , on facebook , all over the social networks is this issue up .
once <unk> i through the <unk> , one of <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of business and i look me the like to .
what have the way in the <unk> , which is there 's how ?
and one day <unk> i was this business with these signs to buy .
and the first sign , that you see here , yes , well that 's actually quite neat .
so , of with this love do instead to work .
i <unk> that , as , my father of five children , but i love , my work in now .
yes .
or still working for <unk> is that <unk> sign .
why that your mindset that it 's degree becomes , and it 's more and more and always on .
someone 's there 's as an answer to this way posted it 's not the monday , it 's your jobs .
and i ask even in fact with the pink glasses , this forward to come and say , okay , put ' time <unk> .
what on my job is beautiful ?
this silly is , even if it 's the pink glasses , is it 's equal everything from like before .
so something nice to talk , n't this is beautiful , is obviously not .
the pink pair 's actually great for bicycle drive .
there holding them a wonderful the fly off , the else in your land were .
but to <unk> <unk> they do n't .
where does us that , if we n't that change ?
actually the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside as become more self-sufficient .
it ends in maybe one system where we so close to us feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this bike and running and running and goes , and eventually it 's too fast , this wheel it caught the poor mouse and they pollution out .
what makes the mouse but ?
she knows itâ€™s not different , she goes back in in the <unk> .
and again , and again , and again , maybe the movie on acknowledges that <unk> do you might after all she falls , soft .
that 's beautiful <unk> here with hay , so they 're doing , yes , there a failure and it 's always again and again so far .
and that what we as funny feeling probably has the mouse and a concussion , yeah ?
or something needs it , that <unk> <unk> .
i went 's in many years ago so when i coming which was from a seminar to home .
and on once she turned out and so the street under me , felt it was completely black , my eyes and somehow got to ' i stop .
the day i went to the doctor , because i 'm thinking , which is because this ?
he got me , and said no way , is physically everything in order .
but how would look at it with the <unk> from ?
and i looked in my calendar , in order to check , and saw , i was three weeks , and somehow <unk> me also the job .
after 20 years of <unk> and collaborator , and so first in the early been wondering whether we the night before , can do .
i 've also thought , what is it actually there anything else for jobs ?
and i 've begun , <unk> , again , other priorities to put , to look , i time with my family <unk> ' , something good for me themselves do .
<unk> ' , whether it 's not just another <unk> there are in my job , a new spark .
i realized , the talks a large groups that make me really joyful .
i do , and as a counseling and <unk> and also some other things , but these sessions impulses give to get to , experiences exchange , who prepare me really joyful .
and that was n't so .
i 've got myself recognizing have to that this <unk> stress sick power .
and sometimes it 's really this shot in the front so , <unk> of me 's degree back from the hospital them had been , after he a heart attack have had and on once he starts as well on , <unk> .
sooner than i said , you leave with to do jogging , he me still <unk> , yes , you with your running and so .
today is he himself .
so , so , with <unk> , beautiful slow , in real <unk> , but eventually we will also in common to do jogging go .
what happened ?
in the bottom line are we all healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve , the amount , is the diseases of mental health .
<unk> minus four percent in the time last decade ago , <unk> almost minus fifty percent , that 's beautiful , this is less .
rise of psychiatric disorders plus <unk> percent .
this is something , where i i think it , so be ?
why is that ?
this is just in austria as ?
no , even in germany is like .
<unk> , <unk> , this is all healthier .
this is so here on the left-hand side to recognize .
it down psychiatric disorders of plus a hundred percent in the last 10 years , finds a a big german <unk> out .
the number of <unk> drugs takes to .
also the cost .
and it start thinking , all sorts of formal , what we can do with this subject ?
do this -- sometimes form , it involuntary <unk> , like for example here .
so is a well-intentioned .
and somebody was once said , no alcohol also is no solution .
but what 's then the solution ?
what is , then , what 's have yet again , healthy power and it and with happiness is ?
and that i was the last years busy .
i 'm thinking about , there 's something like this <unk> , it 's such thing at all be ?
i 'm <unk> , the job is not that what we <unk> is fulfilling and happy to do .
you have many other things that are important , family , health , think and so forth .
but in fact is , that we the the most part of our <unk> in the work on .
and if we do that , why not that 's how do , it 's happy face and also makes other .
the <unk> <unk> ' i you <unk> , as last one supply that way to <unk> and to <unk> it .
these little <unk> , you to hopefully then to spot him .
<unk> is for art execution , liberty and environment .
this is , like <unk> ' i mean talents ?
in which surround do , i that , it with whom ?
that freedom did i here , it to do what i want to do ?
because it 's the degree of <unk> us , <unk> .
the more of them , the more stressful .
and what i do it ?
the execution .
for that are these four areas .
and it can everyone for to myself doing .
i had this for me back on doing a few years and i do that changing over again .
i can my talent use ?
in which environment ?
and this is , sometimes do i in a cafe with my laptop , and princeton prepare for or a <unk> .
the freedom .
that freedom , i can i take in order to do what i 'm important .
and do i do it 's also ?
the execution .
the last u .
and then there 's going back the people to explain why this not about .
and why this at them much harder is .
then i 've often very happy to an answer to this point .
who wants to find ways .
who do n't , has reasons .
and by at the point you can to pick <unk> ' i ways , look , i way or did i reasons why ?
and they 're in both right .
what we do so with our talents somewhere else ?
each of you have his great <unk> did .
that is itâ€™s a lot of small .
that 's filled with talent , with gold , with all sorts , with their qualifications .
what we do it ?
by the <unk> we ask ourselves that .
or if we the hospital is or the end of a life .
what i did with my talent doing ?
incidentally , who 's got has to <unk> <unk> , can like to there 's still access .
so what we do with our talent , is so my first question , even at me for ourselves , and it 's everyday .
<unk> ' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was yet another thing with a story .
that i to tell about <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i at the 'm still do .
this fortress was the about saving for the <unk> as a precise moment five hundred years the enemy coming .
and the enemy realized that the fortress so well designed was that you do you take could .
thick walls steep the ways <unk> to the fortress , thick doors , <unk> , several-fold <unk> .
was <unk> back .
so thought , the thing , okay if we do n't get in , then we a <unk> .
we let 's no more out and in .
let 's how long , the that there 's .
the <unk> it was from long until the day came , where the stock up almost every were .
they had just have a <unk> the was already on the way that , <unk> to be as the <unk> on one time to the bishop says , bishop give me this <unk> and give me three days .
bishop okay , <unk> , you have you been proven , i <unk> ' you , come , take the <unk> and help us .
<unk> going to the <unk> way .
on once look down the enemy how about the wall of the fortress a <unk> to be fooled will always back from left to right , and in the early .
well , think , the , a <unk> , which is that already .
it 's <unk> .

enemies think it , oh , the still has two <unk> , it can , another thing to take .
the night and the same , more time , this is he knows the <unk> , of there on and down by going .
the end of the second day , after the six different <unk> 've seen at doing it in a <unk> off .
because , they thought that takes us too long , that we hold back on not more of .
and then went the <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the one that you had and the they <unk> have .
it 's the <unk> <unk> were born .
i like this idea , that all right there 's what we need , and that we have everything .
sometimes it is knowledge resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's some time .
but also , so we can but do something .
we have no idea of the power , that we have the world every day news to invent .
and if you think that could now a good <unk> be they then right .
in the spring is the spring .
the coming .
and we in <unk> know there does the snow and it 's warmer and catch the plants , of branches brown <unk> to green <unk> to be .
there are blooms eventually come out of those blooms fruits .
there are apples and this very popular and then we harvest and eat .
because it 's grain of this grain could we will grind and of baking .
there are there any animals that this eat .
there is it people that then the products just take it later , food .
and it 's automatically .
but if you think about that it might not so naturally everything is then it a fear and <unk> .
and obviously this is hostile or maybe just very ambiguous and also very theoretically but just in the realm blooms , connection of the blossom to plant are bees a very , very large part .
it 's research , the show that up to <unk> percent of our food , in time food does n't there were if we do n't bees had .
also the sounds like this <unk> , because it this natural for us is and we 're bees might also did not as well .
there 's now some time ago also a very interesting movie , <unk> , the subject .
and i recommend you , you look , it in .
now , but look forward we us on the lord <unk> of which is just with honeybees works , the in his high school , in <unk> the importance of bees can do .
that makes it here at a school at <unk> and he gets us now some things about his work tell .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
first time a big thanks to mr. <unk> and at the whole <unk> .
here to with my project , <unk> more specifically <unk> contribute something like about life of bees .
and this also still under a wing of <unk> about a little <unk> to tell this is fun .
because i would expect me , the most of you <unk> this is it would be well today night a <unk> do it in <unk> minutes in the basics of <unk> bring to want .
that do i do n't , no .
but perhaps get it me , you and get that it this <unk> start to love or a certain empathy to them to develop and you to engage so for this <unk> true , <unk> bug the honey bee .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years young 'm with a wonderful woman married , father of five kids have n't <unk> and have different <unk> and <unk> finished and work for <unk> years of <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member in <unk> <unk> and the non-profit group <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and work now in the <unk> <unk> above of <unk> with our oldest students in <unk> .
we 're working there in the garden , in agriculture and in the <unk> .
<unk> is yes , actually a play of <unk> <unk> and act of <unk> <unk> .
our personal flying classroom is to a <unk> , a quiet , a quiet thing .
and they will also to calm .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and not free have been the ancient greeks the relationship between honey so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> know .
and in a wonderful verse of homer he describes how the <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the sleeping guy poet up to him to inspire him , again , thick can .
but the <unk> go there does not myself in , but they send their blue bees and <unk> now the poet the lips to wax and crawl into the mouth inside and out with him later , the words like honey from the <unk> fall .
a beautiful picture .
hopefully get me that today evening .
yes .
this flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of <unk> , this <unk> the right now my students with me , have built up for 30 to <unk> days in a <unk> .
in <unk> schools of us in <unk> to college or in the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> to <unk> .
a <unk> to <unk> or in <unk> with us in <unk> .
the teacher , the project that accompanied goes with me in the class and we 're looking for a <unk> place for such a <unk> .
usually arrive at the window to the children something can see during this month .
and in all things , so the bees , and then in there are by the hose out and again <unk> can .
there is then at the window a up created .
so .
and then starting the whole with me on the <unk> .
i guess so as a <unk> and jump , now from an existing <unk> two <unk> out and <unk> you now here in these <unk> in .
important in this on this <unk> are <unk> so bees .
also important , we have here <unk> <unk> , and here to the edge , fresh <unk> be , so fresh eggs .
and then it 's also a <unk> , up here .
there 's the honey in .
the need them , if a bad weather is and they do n't fly can .
so .
this is that then out .
then comes the <unk> here again on and begins immediately the transportation of the for <unk> space or at the for <unk> place in school .
and now start something wonderful .
my ladies and gentlemen these bees in there the then in class are experiencing a sudden a crisis .
their people 's not anymore .
they are lonely .
they find your queen 's not .
and this is the most important task from <unk> , when he this <unk> make that he put on paying attention , the queen in ancient people 's left .
that the so not on these two <unk> sitting .
and they 're sad , these bees .


you hear that .
they now almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen together .
and now starting a <unk> .
my ladies and gentlemen , one night developing now you now the need , a new people to form , and all that happened without <unk> , <unk> , without conferences , without having conversations , without opinions and you .
there is the people to agree and you then in the first night is a <unk> .
because without queen going that people after six weeks no longer exist .
because <unk> lives only six weeks for .
so .
and in this first night , you from one of <unk> a pencil out an egg , and bring it into this <unk> in .
and there <unk> is to then just queen going .
everybody , the of you <unk> in the high school was , says , like this is to because go ?
yes , g.m <unk> , is n't all genetically <unk> .
this is true .
and now start something wonderful .
this an egg what 's normally in the <unk> a <unk> become would be in the <unk> a queen .
the egg does the first three days same genetic code like the <unk> .
and it will fed by a <unk> <unk> .
you know this term .
and instantly it changes in this <unk> on <unk> imagine the genetic code .
the <unk> 're going through the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> changed .
we had that i heard about before that that what we eat , the activities , which of us will .
and at the queen is that really wonderful to see .
three days and egg , five days <unk> .
and that can the students all practice which has .
you see that in class .
and then becomes this cell <unk> with a <unk> wax and all that happens then also not because of the people now democratic and <unk> or because one <unk> says , this is to it be , or you republican back then one group saying , you do that now .
no , that happens <unk> .
my ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> that .
and , wait for students that eight days each of my student knows , three , five eight a queen 's doing so <unk> days that these queen fact .
and the day , if it 's so then to happen to , the teacher , it <unk> in the <unk> there <unk> the <unk> at the students get up to five o'clock , yes .
and then say the mother , say time , which is because with you go ?
yes , i have to school in .
yes , why that one ?
yes , our queen fact .
yeah ?
and then the morning about six in school .
and then hit the to their <unk> down at this <unk> , because they practice which has to , like this queen 's now fact .
and if you really that can experience then they stop at first thing .
and the queen <unk> .
so .
still a little bit higher .
and then , the <unk> and cutting the queen 's free .
the first , what the queen 's doing , they spread her wings , and there are now with their <unk> that people what to myself a queen to have their smell , you <unk> , their <unk> .
the people have now then an identity .
now are three to five days for the queen fed .
by the <unk> let 's gon na get them their <unk> <unk> .
the back comes the bat droppings out , from the people , from this <unk> .
and after five days going the queen 's one of the <unk> out .
some of thinking now , yes , i did here has been seen , such a <unk> in <unk> .
hold , stop .
what completely different .
-- that we let .
and the queen the flying now by ourselves without <unk> , without <unk> , from this <unk> out up to two miles high .
you have surely here has been seen in your <unk> .
in the <unk> and is there in a great <unk> now <unk> , of seven to 12 drones , the male bees .
so in reverse like in islam where the man different women have to be here is the queen , the seven to 12 men have .
and all that 's happening in a wonderful way in the flight .
the drone is coming from behind <unk> the queen , and the queen 's getting rid now in this great <unk> all this , what you to seed need to for three years to lay eggs down .
for the drone is it a an amazing experience .
if it 's done with the <unk> dies , and she falls dead by the sky .
and then comes the queen back again and starts , eggs to put .
it 's always a , two students in class , that it immediately see .
that you also see immediately the queen .
yes .
and then turned out to the project in school because now going to the <unk> again <unk> and the queen and the <unk> that will now to tightly in there .
and then come i one night and then they had to this <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> of the outside , and the next morning jump , i this <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and there here you 're still the queen .
yes .
then <unk> .
and around of 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then get these yes , these two <unk> are now here in a <unk> .
in a full cane , in a prey and now can this its size and hard to .
why bees in school ?
my ladies and gentlemen the children who that have seen , forgetting that never more .
yes .
there 's not just like that in this class , students that the time with the bees are together , but the entire school is yes in this class in .
and the teacher , when he something know , when he something can , when he if , he 's a little prepared has the can an era after the other join .
look , bees and just <unk> ago <unk> years ago we cave paintings , where people have the honey harvest have .
in a few months , you have in israel <unk> years old <unk> found in which the people then the bees thought have .
any human culture has with honeybees lived together .
or vice versa , the bees were at any culture in .
in china , in india in persia , in egypt , in greece in rome .
wherever they were in .
the human culture my ladies and gentlemen , here are .
he can a <unk> , a <unk> hook , he can a <unk> join .
my ladies and gentlemen , they know what plants or trees the bees <unk> , what you need ?
that it out there now something out , now in summer in agriculture .
this out there , that 's a green desert for our bees .
yeah ?
he can himself with students in the <unk> go and there flowers the bees <unk> , at <unk> you mark and see how long need the right now , from <unk> up to my flowers ?
how long they 're on the individuals blooms ?
and how long need them , to again , they come back .
he can just <unk> hold .
how <unk> i a hexagon ?
yes .
you know , whether that is so , that the <unk> the peak for the top is or just flat page after the top is ?
you look at a very closely .
he can a math -- , a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can with students even the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> find .
and then get it to the question , how could karl from newly <unk> the nobel prize for real time ?
because he thought , that the bees that look in the hive .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a hive it 's <unk> .
there is also a bee does n't .

as a <unk> net of the wax in the <unk> a <unk> create , and now with <unk> hertz their <unk> there it , and the bees , the <unk> , the pick up with their legs , with their <unk> .
you see , what these bees in school do ?
it 's <unk> par <unk> , and the kids lose your fear of the bees .
and develop an awareness for the bees .
they learn , <unk> , look , what the bees do .
and they get a be aware of these creatures which basically , just us who lives .
the bees do what we have n't let 's a 70 pounds per people in the year .
in <unk> years the only way , candles make .
they accumulate on the are continually out of the trees that <unk> .
this is a <unk> , with the <unk> them their people out .
and now , imagine time ago , the summer , they are <unk> -- , <unk> bees on such an inner space , at <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's this infectious diseases with no end .
no , at the bees do n't .
because they have in this <unk> natural antibiotics .
they accumulate the pollen , and it , they him <unk> , it 'll to <unk> , a give <unk> .
someone , the at the <unk> has is , pneumonia <unk> , <unk> the can now to a <unk> go and , a <unk> prescribe let , by he the <unk> from the people <unk> .
obviously there 's a grid before and with <unk> with a <unk> and so forth , there 's nothing .
yes , and then my ladies and gentlemen and pollinating the <unk> do that the bees of course , and we have less apples , if the bees and not fly would or we would like the chinese who on the <unk> <unk> and they themselves pollinating .
there is it much more context .
you look at the <unk> , out there on the meadow is the also the growing on the <unk> , where the cows graze .
and there flies the bee up , puts up their nectar and fermented this <unk> .
and now comes the cow and down the <unk> and just because they <unk> <unk> inclusive , they can digest .
yeah ?
and then <unk> you that back and notice , ah , yes , i did <unk> <unk> , ah , i can it again <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yeah ?
and to , then gives the bee 's have the most valuable , what it on the from nature is there .
the honey .
i want , quickly to the point where are , <unk> .
my students are , every year when you this <unk> build and then it with me together in the schools .
that 's now not my <unk> but once i had a student , and since i 've told the <unk> the secondary in <unk> and i said , you , <unk> ' put you know themselves before .
and then he says , yes , so , i hot , <unk> <unk> .
i come from <unk> at <unk> and i 'm twenty years .
and i 'm for five years in <unk> and for two years ago when thomas in <unk> .
and i <unk> ' me , i now not more with the <unk> learn to , but with my hands can learn .
<unk> , yes , with the head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , <unk> college .
and more than half said , oh yeah , it will we also .
my students see here is an incredible appreciation and the all between , in <unk> , normal and the <unk> people get through the bees salvaged .
on <unk> meet them , and they have confidence , my students and of a proud .
how do you to the bee ?
the question is wrong .
you would say , how do you to <unk> the <unk> ?
and there can think ' , i also because it 's the human , of the other people <unk> and it 's a new <unk> there .
and he says , so , start with it in .
the end of a little poem from <unk> of <unk> .
who like the bee would be the the sun by the <unk> feel that the way to blossom , and never the way out of the would be the fields in <unk> glamour as quickly he also lived he 'd ever cry .
thank you .
hello , love her friends in the world .
welcome to show my project .
this project of person and my wife .
it 's the fight for an end of female genital mutilation .
in my eyes the greatest crimes of humanity , because it there 've been <unk> years .
the society against the women with still , six thousand give a day .
first <unk> ' i 'm going .
my name is <unk> , i come in hamburg ?
there i was <unk> years a <unk> on .
and you can think that me the job n't <unk> has .
i felt i 'm not <unk> .
and so i was glad that i 'm in the theme <unk> well <unk> and exciting govern pull could .
for example this .
with a massive <unk> about the atlantic ocean of africa , brazil .
on the sail a plea on the <unk> brazil 's the prepared myself genocide in the last <unk> <unk> the <unk> , to prevent .
it was a ride , where i more <unk> was as <unk> , more <unk> as <unk> .
anyway , like that has a match , that interest in the media to find and even a little person like i could his cause the world language into .
<unk> i did with their own <unk> the <unk> in ethiopia <unk> .
then there was there war between <unk> and ethiopia and we were <unk> of the killings there .
and despite all cruelty , that we 've had , we experienced in other side of the infinity hospitality of <unk> us , into <unk> , arab hospitality .
and once it was that we invaded , and our two <unk> , that you see here , and with their bodies as living <unk> before us <unk> , and the <unk> said that 's my an .
if you the killing want you do by us , shooting .
something like i did n't in another culture found .
and back in boys years have learned that you islam not reduce can to terrorism .
and christians do itâ€™s not be reduced to their terrorism .
for example , the <unk> .
the <unk> , the <unk> .
but rather on the true value as charity , social responsibility that <unk> .
this is the values , for the , it 's worthwhile to fight .
after many years i 'm again in this <unk> been , together with my wife <unk> .
and since we heard then of this <unk> female genital mutilation .
when i then heard that <unk> percent of everyday victims <unk> are the rest 're christians and <unk> did i thought , how a <unk> how islam , besides all of terror , that still <unk> in the shoes push now ?
and the idea was there the top makers of islam and get the need to sin to explain .
we search for comrades in arms , the germans organizations that we have n't find .
because we had to us then hear now we would like i would be completely <unk> , of islam is really not <unk> .
you would i the throat on .
on <unk> of amnesty and then we have <unk> our own organization started .
and were of <unk> and <unk> independently .
and to now this battle , even get to do we needed images .
it was a lack .
and so moved <unk> and i back into this desert in order to hidden camera these images to do .
the bad bloody pictures that i show you do n't , but i want to the crime drawing .
girl at the age of four weeks to go to the wedding be at some of their parents and related <unk> , to earth put you 'll be on the limbs , and cutting them without anesthesia , the clitoris and the <unk> off for suturing with a <unk> the <unk> to , without anesthesia , with <unk> systems with no amount of hygiene , anatomy and the <unk> is to <unk> .
what you left is a up from the size of <unk> .
<unk> is now one <unk> .
if you they typically get ask them to two weeks .
never thought in the body and soul , creating their dignity .
this was the beginning of so-called <unk> <unk> .
in the <unk> it goes on .
the man has to you open .
he never has a <unk> woman seen .
the <unk> , he said , oh , ibrahim , is n't no problem .
you 're rubbing your penis with <unk> a and then you bump you hard by .
and if you do n't it can make , is not too bad .
and then they are you kidding that knife and <unk> you .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and dies a third of girls .
that you had to three months <unk> .
in shock , the girl its language lost .
this is the <unk> , also some in asia .
the most are predominantly islamic govern .
and whenever we muslims said , why did you did that ?
was the <unk> answer , that we need to do this is in the koran .
nothing is in the koran of them , quite the opposite .
each one of believing <unk> five times every day in prayer , as one <unk> , the creator , is , perfect , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to think , what you there praying .
they assume <unk> , a <unk> to be the women are has created and why you , well as <unk> person <unk> could , to women <unk> .
but now we had the pictures of the first comrades in arms was this sultan .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there 's hard discussions , two days .
but we had the <unk> at our site , the top <unk> at our side .
and then the great decision , of practice is against all human rights , against the religion , we need to him one minute .
as recently have the way sultan this new <unk> signed .
and if you africa and the <unk> know , know , you just that has to these people very valid .
and it has been celebrating and these successes we had then also in other countries .
quick example , another , <unk> there <unk> us the highest spiritual , the <unk> of the country his message , it is a crime , on <unk> to write and that now in the <unk> to carry .
for weeks , we were traveling , with your own camels .
hundreds <unk> we had in .
and where we came , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical , saints hospitality experienced .
and when we land that eventually leaving to said , the great scholar and <unk> <unk> , you want to now actually all <unk> countries work ?
so much lifetime will <unk> do n't you more give .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> and there you have to start to get to .
and especially , he had an idea .
he said , if it 'll get , the ten <unk> muslims the world to a table to bring and the explain the need to sin , then it 's a sin .
<unk> and i flew in cairo in the <unk> and -- mosque comparable to the vatican the <unk> .
and in <unk> for <unk> quite the <unk> , his <unk> professor doctor ali <unk> we got a <unk> .
he listened to the idea of was thrilled , especially , when we his notion , we we finance this would .
and do that we just about an , the support us .
and then he said , i 'm going to the conference not just <unk> , such as we it being asked had , but i 'm going to the <unk> take over .
and that has he did .
over cairo <unk> sometime in the years <unk> our transparent .
international <unk> , on the <unk> of female body through circumcision .
under the <unk> of <unk> professor doctor ali <unk> .
and all are they did .
hundreds <unk> , but the top of the world .
in the middle of <unk> of qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and the rest of europe he 's the cause of <unk> because of the cartoons .
so men that life and death can decide .
but 's also the other .
the left the <unk> <unk> , right of <unk> , my <unk> .
the top of the world .
about where i 'm going <unk> me , just a vacuum , and <unk> personally .
and then i did you all embraces .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at <unk> from left <unk> of egypt .
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> egypt , <unk> of woman mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much for the subject , of islam is not <unk> .
we were also -- nothing that on their way more time <unk> , what 's a terrible you women 's particularly , with the <unk> .
and then got <unk> your film show , <unk> .
reality .
the men had needing wet eyes .
they dressed you back behind <unk> doors to just two hours you had decided and a <unk> wrote , a <unk> .
the <unk> 're going on the cameras , declared , what you decided to have .
and the most important set in it , it was this .
female genital mutilation is a <unk> crime and against the highest value of islam it .
he <unk> the <unk> .
we thought , the job is done had but the calculation without our <unk> done .
because the embarrassment about , the abdomen the woman to talk , is more remained as any mind .
so we <unk> .
we have that we have the conference going to document in this so-called golden book .
a <unk> for the <unk> this world .
and because ali <unk> , the <unk> , it as well thought , the book , he it with a shake blessed .
it 's going to us from the hands and .
we were in many countries had to then at conferences have to the on top <unk> .
and you read that with interest in some were so excited , they the book <unk> have .
unfortunately , but have the most not the courage put this , well , to announce .
over the abdomen the wife gets to you 're not in the mosque talk .
just some have the courage attached .
they 're at least in the universities gone , on <unk> .
and sometimes we have a bold <unk> found that actually in the mosque about <unk> have , like here .
and then it out of speakers in the <unk> .
and this is that itâ€™s the subjects .
that it to spread .
but i go over the of time .
it 's all drop in hot rocks , and so i 'm working on many other strategy , this topic , <unk> .
the need less than .
but my <unk> that would be this .
i want to the great message of the highest <unk> the world announce the birthplace of islam is there on the kaaba in mecca .
not in so <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
so here four million people come together , men and women <unk> islamic <unk> .
then <unk> ' i with all those who and the <unk> king my transparent up there between the mosque minarets are <unk> .
i do this one here has been trained , in the <unk> .
unfortunately , are still with me the last <unk> , that would be the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure , when he of <unk> it would be part .
for a to these women to help .
the other , in the world of time to show , which the true value of islam is , instead of the time demonstrate to make .
from terrorists than <unk> .
if it does n't do then <unk> ' i might this , which in hamburg , for its first time had .
that at least a lot <unk> in the mosque participate in the world .
and we our transparent there <unk> could .
and may experience i this yet , that the little girl his daughters not more <unk> must .
then has , my life that really was totally worth .
and i want appeal to each this , now ours , or have seen , to join .
also not be part 's an <unk> .
we need to the practice in the ton do otherwise , right now here , this stage , not one .
and now i want them in closing the concept of my <unk> have to show .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .
and this is in all <unk> up there arabic in the name <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that always have to anticipate .
down there we have , it also in german .
female genital mutilation is with the koran , and the ethic of islam incompatible .
it 's <unk> and a discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'll start , so that time in .
so saw the <unk> out , you as a refugee in germany would get .
at <unk> pay attention <unk> have my mother , my brother and i first time , so one package <unk> .
and , it <unk> .
my mom was completely terrified , because they did n't understand 's why the us now <unk> food have given .
the third day , we finally resolved .
we stood on the trash to this stuff again , throw away then got a <unk> wife and <unk> that easy to <unk> out .
they tried to us to tell you know that you can eat .
this is not spoiled .
it tastes , actually very good .
it 's cheese .
my mother was the brow up and we laughed .
cheese .
in my homeland , we have it <unk> but the 's not that <unk> smell .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
in fifteen years ago i 'm with my mother and my brother of china to germany fled .
from that run <unk> ' i now tell .
but most it 's me about , in the people that these run to have and to a success did .
but first talk , i you where i just come from .
i 'm <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> , in the northwest of china life .
and this region is from the chinese that autonomous area <unk> called .
it 's about <unk> miles from germany away .
in china live in 10 million <unk> but in munich is the largest <unk> community of china .
and these <unk> life and so here because in china under constant <unk> ailments have to .
hundreds of thousands chinese were shot to <unk> moved by that we in our own home to a minority become are .
our own native language , <unk> was from the system eliminated .
in schools and in college only be more chinese taught .
and our religion can we also not free celebrate .
the <unk> losing so their culture and identity .
and if , somebody -- is and for the rights of <unk> in may become a long <unk> torture , or even die .
it was also the reason why my parents , i 've decided , with us kids to escape .
this was <unk> and i was at 11 years old .
now that is about to our escape from .
we did n't enough money , so had to my father first time <unk> .
i <unk> ' at me many people , the us at the run have helped .
i <unk> ' at me many images .
i <unk> ' me , but first of <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> , it kind of me , if i my eyes <unk> .
he was big had just <unk> on , and and we met him , with his little <unk> on a parking space .
the first rate has over .
i know , many a negative image of <unk> have that the only do business to refugees abuse and they did n't for the fates care .
but i 'd ' say i 'd , it as <unk> call , not as <unk> .
because <unk> has us <unk> accompanied .
he was at the airport in <unk> on a <unk> and has to the last end <unk> , whether we also really sure through the <unk> coming .
airport in <unk> we walked on , you and i know yet , as my mother of said to me is just get out of the airport .
turn beside you do n't about .
until we 're out .
because i did it in my hand a pass , and there was also my photo in but there was an alien name , <unk> .
i had as <unk> through the <unk> .
and i <unk> ' at me <unk> <unk> of me was he had my watch out in your hands .
silence .
sweat .
a long view .
we were at <unk> .
in munich came <unk> ' i at me a lot of workers us , somehow , who have .
i <unk> ' me of the <unk> woman , the with us in the <unk> used to have .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per <unk> 13 full-size families .
at least forty children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
it was stranger faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to us a <unk> pieces .
there was eating , slept and done homework .
friends coming now not to visit because i <unk> , where we resided .
just my <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> knew anything .
they knew my story and was ostensibly me a and they took care , to me .
for example , it brought me to <unk> <unk> what i now not more do .
but it helped me , somehow , german at know .
i spent my whole puberty in <unk> .
it 's for my mother 's not easy .
by himself with us kids with her husband and always in the uncertainty because we had itâ€™s just a <unk> and able to any relegated to be .
i <unk> ' i remember that i really , really aggressive was to the time .
it 's me also slightly embarrassing , that now here all to tell , but now i have just to my history .
i was really aggressive and able to school in a kind of focus .
that brought us first to catholic <unk> where we the first time to normal children in contact coming .
with normal my ' i the kids not in a <unk> it had .
i <unk> ' i also on the <unk> the me and my brother . to <unk> or <unk> sent to have .
just so we bit out .
i <unk> ' i also on several <unk> <unk> the ourselves a homework done have , because our parents not a german could .
or the have to us just painting .
we have to whatever was very glad .
i know yet , how we always before the fence line up and waited until these people came , because , sort of took the foreign people for us time , and that was us back then count .
after two years finally got my father to germany .
the problem was but , that it directly from <unk> to <unk> relegated to was because it in munich supposedly no room more for him there .
i <unk> ' me of the very , very who lawyer who did it has , my father before the <unk> to china to keep us they made it actually , that it with us in munich housing for letting me .
i <unk> ' at me this time where i really , very , very happy was because after six years <unk> got we finally in a standard apartment across .
we got a <unk> for three years and we had finally one own home with a your bathrooms here and of your kitchen .
and i had actually a room .
it was that is very small and i did n't have desk in , but it was good , i could my door gates .
and i <unk> ' me that i the time , yeah , very well used have , but i had yet the <unk> without a major leave .
i looked for me really no way .
there was a <unk> , the me in <unk> , who has and it 's still going on the idea that i about the second <unk> my degrees <unk> can .
first <unk> then the <unk> .
i appreciate the teacher , that really at me thought and i was really not just to the time i managed it even up to the middle <unk> .
and i came to <unk> .
and before , i <unk> came i played by the way with my best friend <unk> at <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project of organized <unk> .
but i was no good <unk> that did i also just done because we by <unk> a place had where we simply could go .
we had a <unk> , which we our aggression <unk> could .
and the heads of <unk> helped us sort of that we our problems to tell you could and he was ostensibly us and could look at all ask kind of <unk> .
and then i came to <unk> , <unk> .
and that 's a project , where young people without a closing the possibility of wars , and artistic <unk> .
that has to really very well done , and i realized , art is something which i also slightly <unk> .
by <unk> and the connect to <unk> was a filmmaker , to us .
he made the movie <unk> about life of my friends and me .
and the film won lots of awards .
we realized that the people , for our history interesting .
he was a very special feeling , because we it is ever had had , that people 's listening have .
and that is a moment where i thought , okay .
i do n't want more officers hanging around .
i want to do anything from my life make .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees got me on the idea for to a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to join .
but because i in the bold building me completely lost was i ended up at random at a <unk> for a play and the title is <unk> top four .
so i was just right .
i was playing with .
and this thing is that after a performance two editors from <unk> <unk> on me <unk> .
and i had asked , if i interest had just let 's own <unk> to do .
i thought , super , <unk> .
you do , i with .
and i did for the radio program marking <unk> now , pulse <unk> and one of posts about a play <unk> , where i which also <unk> was for the european <unk> <unk> .
and i got it also actually won .
now now i at the college for <unk> and movie munich <unk> already in the third year and 'm <unk> the <unk> .
and it all be for me not been possible if not one or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> well , for me in have .
they have to me thought they have to spaces open , they have to ways of showing how i my place in society me <unk> can .
and to come ' i now to them .
each of you have the way , people like to help me second chance to get and their lives or her place in society to find .
because , the people , every day come time a hundred refugees in munich , and each of you 're with hope and each of you have a huge potential .
they have it with great determination to many terrible barriers behind , to make .
and this determination you could really big profit for germany be , and for every single one of us too .
and i could actually a thousand things to talk about what you can make , but because i no longer enough time , though there is , a minute their 40s , i did you a <unk> brought .
extended them now your cellphone out you can not to tell , they no code scan can .
scan them the code a and then they come on the side of <unk> with a feedback , what they have can do .
and that would us right of help .
i <unk> me now here has been for their engagement and we see us out hope .
and then scan them the code a .
i <unk> , it .
many have the mobile phone did n't even in your hands .
you are like to become , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> yes .
first time a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
excites me , we connect have .
my name is robin .
my <unk> 's going to simpler than it to talk .
i come , in austria , this is in vienna .
i <unk> ' i still very , today in <unk> be to get to , is really beautiful here .
i in a me here every time very comfortable .
and that 's not a phrase , that 's a sense .
yes , yes , in contrast to the other <unk> i 'm not here today , and you about anything to <unk> .
i did n't , what .
but it 's so , i text write in my spare time and then some talk ' , usually at <unk> <unk> or <unk> or just events like the modern day .
yes , and i was today , asked , so a few texts read , in the entire program a little <unk> .
and so that 'll ' , i do here .
yes .
i start with a joke .
meeting , two chicken .
this tells a so , are two english chickens i <unk> you and <unk> so not <unk> , but <unk> here has been very funny i <unk> you and <unk> grassroots <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
says that other yeah .
he <unk> ca n't <unk> me .
so if we have this level chassis .
the first text is a little <unk> , that i just written gotcha . ''
i did , it was a person 's devoted to me , partly which means has .
it carries the title <unk> .
and well , they did it at themselves did n't understand .
when your head in my lap , slept your rest of my ceiling .
my leg was also under my ceiling your leg was outside the ceiling .
my leg , for by the ceiling .
it 's about her head is hold on my lap answered me , the rest of you among the ceiling , my leg as well under the ceiling , her leg outside the ceiling .
that has <unk> , as if only my leg extremely long .
it was very romantic .
the next text i 've also then one person at me , very much does .
and it 's my grandpa owned .
we 've ever since no contact more .
my <unk> grandfather was of graphic butcher .
already a child has it with love <unk> cut .
going to me just like , yes .
yes , even 'n text .
get better not that .
jesus is the single deal with is at the <unk> at the glass of the bus .
but where was jesus as he me , that <unk> <unk> , saving to ?
there is to think , yeah ?
i was my <unk> been brought ?
soon text .
the next text is slightly longer .
he takes nearly half hours .
so for writing .
read you go faster .
is the beginning of a novel that i degrees in the <unk> <unk> . ''
ah , it 's going to <unk> guy , so the adventures from a guy , the again , the hair color codes them and a little too much <unk> .
i <unk> ' me , but over again to this point of the <unk> i distance themselves .
because i 'd ' i never the hair inside .
chapter one .
if i <unk> is my head empty .
so empty like the sheet , that he now to fill tried .
yes , and i 'm not come .
very hard half hours .
the next text is also a little <unk> .
most people understand it .
i 'm ' i myself too hard .
and it 's the , i play , like with my vocabulary and with my language .
i did , always been like with me playing .
and well , then get hold these things out .
it carries the title <unk> .
is a little bit strange yet <unk> .
is probably the <unk> <unk> , that i ever written gotcha .
<unk> we can .
yes , we come .
we all can .
we <unk> .
but i ca n't .
but i can it .
i can not .
i can not .
yes , i have it yourself also did n't understand .
no idea .
yes , yes , clap of me .
i 'm ' time , either all or no .
the next sheet has also what do with text to .
is something like a little <unk> .
i did ' at the time for insects you .
very polite .
yes , even 'n text .
is a little <unk> .
and it 's about it 's cool time i so do that her three tell you might wonder .
my text is the title , all good stuff is cool .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> so dry .
<unk> we <unk> <unk> .
so to stroke , <unk> , <unk> and scraping and then becomes all the better and well , that 's it .
more a moment .
yes , even 'n <unk> , this is this time a different .
and it 's about it 's cool time i so do , that we all so just kind <unk> could do , so 'n try we all time .
right , so , that what the wind power stop .
the text is the title <unk> and goes this way .
yes .
is fun to , you .
the <unk> text is simply just a sentence .
i <unk> ' so like to little <unk> .
this is a <unk> sexual pun .
sexual is with <unk> s you .
<unk> s ?
yes , yes .
is fun to , you .
yes , even 'n sentence .
the is in <unk> you .
is a very long sentence .
i think it 's almost impossible , <unk> in <unk> to explain , this is the point .
here , still a text .
this day is a <unk> .
is the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he did it already know , before i it as such <unk> have .
he got me purpose of a woken , then he would me <unk> let .
i could me later still in him <unk> .
i 've got him the joy done .
it as <unk> of all other days <unk> and me back to sleep down .
with a <unk> <unk> the face where else ?
and purpose , it not anymore to credit , by i <unk> .
and should i later , but again , waking can , it does n't about a <unk> day acted .
there hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .

i <unk> .
so .
letter <unk> sounds like the cow .
so that 's funny .
yes , the next text also has this paper memorized learned .
is more what political .
so , i <unk> , not just fun things .
i <unk> ' also partially very political things .
and it 'll ' i often wondered , where i <unk> . ''
and yes , there did i just this text here you .
he 's the title <unk> .
my father came from vienna , then in my mother and i from her .
yes .
if we have this <unk> .
thank you for the noise .
yes , at this point 'd ' i like a little do advertising .
i ca n't business cards or so afford , so i have that always <unk> do .
and it 's <unk> ' i which also events and i go which also a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
can like to just show up .
and well , i <unk> ' , i <unk> ' actually very <unk> .
and yes .
that would ' i just have said .
it goes on the program .
more advertising .
this is a little advertising , that i just written gotcha .
feet .
realm of vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin <unk> .
here has been very funny .
i want ' a joke about the <unk> your girlfriend write but the punch line was just only flat .
yes , is not , my <unk> .
<unk> you have to stop the <unk> <unk> <unk> you have to with the <unk> <unk> of it .
yes .
thank you for listening .
you were great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me the same with a <unk> question start .
why do you <unk> actually do ?
i mean , everybody , the tax is supposed to wonder whether it at least some potentially of society which give back can .
the answer is clearly .
we know now , the life expectancy for at the birth just to about <unk> percent genetically <unk> is .
that is it has to any kind of environmental impacts , <unk> give the impact on <unk> have .
why we know yet still so little ?
why we 'll bombarded by <unk> messages from the <unk> , and the part of each other <unk> ?
you remember , all in fifteen years seemed the <unk> found .
it was fat .
you thought , and if you fat from the food <unk> , we 're all got and be healthy old .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves with different <unk> in american way has led and what do n't it 's changed , the americans every year thicker become are .
then you said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the carbs .
then what to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and so on has led .
so it over again , ai new <unk> sow through it village <unk> .
how do all the <unk> ?
now , the reason is , for my taste , for part at least , that by <unk> <unk> approaches anecdotal <unk> to the wisdom <unk> .
typical situation for a <unk> alone is here .
the <unk> you know it all .
<unk> published a lot most widely magazine a new rubric .
the top <unk> the <unk> <unk> for that provide a year .
keith richards was seven years for the number one <unk> .
and then they died the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest man , the in the on earth has lived .
<unk> years old become .
i know , there somewhere the people argue , they are six hundred , can but just your <unk> n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> become .
and they listened to <unk> on to smoke started but with <unk> again , and then finally , with <unk> <unk> the path of the virtue to follow and stop to smoke .
with <unk> is then they died .
which tells us that ?
not that which healthy are .
but it tells us that age very complicated is and that we clean statistics to do we need simple experimental systems and we need to simple questions do .
ai very simple question , and a very simple issue , the in different countries preserved is women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know it now .
this is on testosterone at <unk> so what in the male <unk> produced .
and there are <unk> very simple evidence for this <unk> men are just like age as women .
can now everybody for yourself think if it a <unk> <unk> is .
austria 's a 's free land .
but you get better yet tips , not afraid .
we find we going to hats correlation with <unk> to confuse .
sounds complicated , is but just the usual <unk> to <unk> .
and visited so someone just <unk> grandma , and asks what you have because that way you accomplished or different eaten , they that old become are ?
ah .
the granny 's every day 10 cigarettes <unk> .
that 's probably the secret of their ages , right ?
and have the ten which may just not <unk> .
or but they have <unk> and the granny would without the ten cigarettes , grow .
ourselves hard statistics are not always <unk> .
there for example , just very hard statistics , that shows that people that <unk> in of tuscany go to get older be as people that 's not .
particularly .
is <unk> .
this is at the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's because remember that the people just enough money in his pocket have to be good for her age and the <unk> available to deal .
if i but one group of <unk> a <unk> to feed me give and this group to 20 percent live longer than just group taken that the <unk> just do n't get it , but otherwise , exactly the same thought was then i was actually probably a <unk> factor in the diet by .
and indeed are these attempts been done .
must tell you , the <unk> 's very <unk> what but even i with my enemies are on me is that <unk> fast during the life expanding .
and that work for the different organisms .
for example , the bacteria .
you see there ai <unk> of bacteria .
if we the fast , in the <unk> line showing then life that much longer .
the same thing for <unk> , provide fly mice and recently was only so about two years in america has shown that it even for monkey is true .
and it goes not about , thin to be .
it 's too , <unk> the <unk> kitchen .
and that 's another experiment , which in the united states has been done .
what did you did here ?
you have just <unk> , and has one of this so-called <unk> to , a <unk> diet where you so as many <unk> one day and night get it .
and who wonder what , the mice are being dick became , sick and have just very bad <unk> had and bad <unk> .
now , you ai parallel <unk> , and that has the exactly the same number of <unk> fed just that <unk> just break was .
that have day nothing to eat , for you have at twice as much eating .
and these <unk> now 's got and healthy and they also has no <unk> .
although both of mice <unk> is feeding were .
they did just ate too much .
the a sick and the other healthy .
what happened there really ?
it 's a process called cellular <unk> or <unk> clicked on .
whenever you organisms , or cells food take away then starting the organism on , <unk> constituents in the cell or to degraded . off to take it again , energy to do .
that makes sense .
and this looks like this .
you can see how in the cell , and <unk> are mainly , to present , the during the ages <unk> .
the <unk> then with the stomach the parts are <unk> and the cell as energy back to apply to put .
it 'll just damages on the age accumulate into limits that .
this is quite the molecular <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> often tell .
so , it in summary <unk> fast expanding the life in different organisms .
and it 's probably , just assume , that the also in people work .
and we learn from it , it 's not like in <unk> recommended every little <unk> the day with two decades <unk> fight to .
no .
but , they 're going to say , if you 're hungry have , ah , perhaps is just the <unk> clicked on .
welcome you your hunger like a boyfriend .
and that 's also <unk> sense .
while <unk> point nine nine percent of human history has the human being what did , when he hunger had ?
right , he is they 've gone .
we go out regularly , at the fridge hunt , if we 're hungry have .
and that 's safe to the biology .
now we know , and that 's already in the bible , in <unk> chapter <unk> verse <unk> , the mind is child soldiers : , but the meat is weak .
this 're gon na look for us very different .
this sort of ariana bleau <unk> in a medieval paradise shown .
the three <unk> here it goes well , the food the day , let 's also those .
and that 's sort of the actual <unk> .
we have us so on the to look for substances done , the the molecular response of <unk> turn though the organism eat .
that could for people to be interesting , whose <unk> is not enough just <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it could we might , one of the hardest <unk> of life maintain .
the question is so that we can <unk> , the <unk> , the cellular biology <unk> turn , although you eat ?
and we have many hundreds , at the thousand substances is a piece , natural substances .
we have in fact , a found , that means <unk> .
<unk> is a substance , the in all of organisms naturally does the but also in all of organisms during the <unk> less will .
in your skin is it at <unk> .
<unk> people have been much less <unk> in your skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells are , for example , then you see this .
this is just is through cell here .
is the <unk> , the <unk> we give <unk> put on and we see many thousands of this little <unk> in the cell of the the present , the during the ages <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells going to look exactly .
and it works in different organisms .
this instance shown on a <unk> .
so we 've just for found that the molecular <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
life because the organisms that even more .
and the answer is again , you see here just a <unk> by a <unk> .
there are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days that are all dead , and forty days is about half dead .
whenever we <unk> to drinking give , here in actually going to the animals grow and surviving better .
we also know , that human cells that we of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have in culture about three times as long survive , if we you with <unk> put yourself .
and latest research put too close that even the lives of all over mice by <unk> expanding it .
and is not only life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are clearly <unk> .
so .
now you want to of course , all know , where is <unk> on ?
how the name it says , it 's the sperm discovered was , because it comes in very high levels of .
but i can you <unk> , even in <unk> fresh green and pepper mushrooms cheese , and a product of <unk> <unk> , which in japan big <unk> enjoys , that 's so <unk> <unk> 's very much <unk> ago .
we have to then i said , if <unk> against <unk> helps , by it the present <unk> it helps you might also to <unk> ?
they have to which is know that the common point of all <unk> diseases is that during the ages <unk> the brain <unk> .
and we have in fact experiments to do .
they 're going to wonder , we have the on fruit flies do .
fruit flies are which is also <unk> , if you to age .
they have more <unk> the brain , if you to age .
and the molecular mechanisms that for remembrance of these are very much like the people .
now and ask anyway , like to hell does that guy that memory of fruit flies measured ?
this is the experiment , what we share with stefan these seals of college berlin did .
you take a fruit flies and put that 's a give them one another , the they love .
<unk> .
and let the , in this <unk> <unk> .
then you take the same fly , give them in the next chamber , and give you <unk> different smell , the they love , which is <unk> .
we let them the <unk> enjoy , as they but just <unk> <unk> .
classic <unk> .
then take them back the same fly , do that here in .
the driving this degree in the <unk> down , there you that .
and when it down here has come are , give them from the one hand <unk> and of other hand <unk> it .
where do that all going ?
right .
the <unk> .
except the two here .
this is the <unk> .
or , we say , they have character .
i love my <unk> and i want ' 'm not by this ai <unk> reward <unk> .
okay .
is but just form of <unk> , the with age increases .
not only at flying .
and we could actually the <unk> of flying through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , and back into .
and the <unk> , in the brain came out were , were back by .
this is , <unk> does n't just to aging , but also to <unk> diseases , maybe some .
and that 's important because we want , the <unk> not the age , se increase .
it does n't make sense , the time of <unk> to increase .
and i want you do n't come , without you just let 's a few practical tips to give we we maybe some younger stay .
another time <unk> fast .
it 's not about , you weight on or so .
it 's actually now in austria ai group of <unk> people that one day eat and a day n't eat .
this is the way that so-called <unk> under the leadership of <unk> elena and erwin haas .
and the present this very well in .
this is , it 's <unk> .
avoid it <unk> .
it 's not to carbs complex carbs seem to do n't even dangerous to be .
it 's really about candy .
you know now , that <unk> sufficient are in , diabetes person , even then when they got these are .
and you know as well , that sugar the growth of tumors accelerate can .
here it ai <unk> , the front of the ages .
after 30 days that are all dead .
very small dosage of glucose reach out .
for a <unk> effect to create .
there 's just an example , it works in almost all of organisms that .
food they regularly fruit and vegetables .
avoid them the gift of a lot <unk> or of <unk> ever .
you know now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer can deploy .
this is not under the circumstances of vitamin d .
we are there might have degrees ' in winter a <unk> , because vitamin d is by sunlight on the skin building .
some them at least three times per week just half hour sports , that 's trivial .
which in spite of <unk> <unk> examples of them <unk> 10 to fifteen years lifetime .
do they 're in times of eternal <unk> occasionally the peace in .
the impact of praying , and blood pressure on the life expectancy is to .
because monks lives almost as long , how women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> are still , no longer than <unk> .
just <unk> dying because sooner than <unk> .
what is that ?
the people assume , that 's what do with some substances to .
no way , no way , that 's very simple .
if now here a <unk> at the window is then plaster ' i the with <unk> <unk> solution way .
and what that 's probably in your <unk> .
<unk> scaling , <unk> and so what , are by drinking the circumstances there <unk> .
so , alcohol of all just <unk> well .
a permanent partner , or just 's family with longevity associated .
you should not at a lot <unk> street live .
now you think about to <unk> .
that has but with <unk> did not to .
it 's going to <unk> .
you can measure the closer to someone at a lot <unk> road does , as more <unk> he 's the blood .
and it as well , when he says , i 've got me has even used to .
i can have any sleep and the sound i do n't mind .
not true .
he 's still more <unk> in the blood and that 's bad .

we know now , that <unk> very good metabolic effects , did .
of all do it the <unk> down .
and we also know that onions and <unk> mice against the infectious diseases protect .
knew that by our grandmothers also been the us with <unk> and so on <unk> have .
it certainly do n't no sense .
many studies show that dark chocolate , dementia <unk> do can .
just recently is a beautiful study still , that showed , that just half board dark chocolate a day the <unk> of a <unk> on this level of a <unk> can get .
kind of course you of coffee there 's the <unk> but thinner .
it 's the studies that the show , there 's the studies that 's not show .
what 's clear , is that coffee , diabetes <unk> , it and so their metabolic performance better .
and coffee is actually also a good <unk> because he solves <unk> out , like us together with <unk> <unk> from paris you could .
ai very nice and intricate study in the 100,000 people fifteen years for at they have shown that people that every day ai handful of nuts eat their <unk> about 20 percent down .
this is a huge value for just <unk> study .
and this is for almonds , gathering brazil nuts , pistachios glued , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not to peanuts all the botanically in seen in fact , beans are .
the give just on , by it and nuts call , okay ?
this is that but actually , beans .
so for peanuts is n't that .
the next thing is a little <unk> .
avoid them the shot of to a lot of animal protein , so of meat and <unk> , but only if you between <unk> and <unk> years old are .
ai very beautiful new research shows that you , if you in this <unk> to a lot of animal protein to , and take her <unk> so strong increase , as if you a strong smokers were .
this is not for the time after that where animal protein are good and it 's obviously not for <unk> children or adolescent , the animal protein need and it 's not for pregnant and those individuals who it to be .
we find is that they <unk> .
what , whatever they do , keep them silky that knew already , friedrich nietzsche said , has the objection to , the <unk> , that a happy suspicion that <unk> are signs of health .
everything <unk> heard in the office .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> the has about after this regime lived and he 's <unk> years old become .
it comes from my home <unk> from the <unk> , is never get sick become .
and he goes 's very good .
he 's just not a <unk> alone do n't anecdote but he lives in a <unk> , where it too many healthy <unk> there .
it 's about the <unk> followed , i you today 've said .
we should at all the <unk> experiments , just an important fact , not passed .
which is that this <unk> of <unk> me in a biological but a social seems to be , and so eventually a <unk> .
you <unk> the old people less to and could one of <unk> mistake of our culture be .
<unk> wrote the biggest one roman the <unk> a year ago , he died .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece , at the contemporary critics of all the adolescent fresh <unk> .
thank you so for listening .
i want to start with a question , i you spot .
a question , where now no one up to , because that 's a bit of avalokitesvara , who of them is lonely ?
the <unk> is something very low .
without even when i thought .
it has but probably reasons why you do n't play have , that , the people that for , which is viewed <unk> would .
many people confuse <unk> and loneliness and think that were <unk> .
it is that actually not true .
will find one is actually more like a phenomenon of people than just to be .
maybe it 's because also remember that you do n't play have , because the question fuzzy put it .
it feels lonely , or is you lonely ?
you can be lonely feel , without feeling lonely to be .
and you can lonely be no , in the moment lonely to feel .
one 's too much to shame to .
and that 's some now here from have , and to loneliness to <unk> .
one thing is in shame and shame , in one .
one takes time .
it 's going to now here they reported have in the few seconds , which i you 've given .
one needs <unk> .
one needs the time to be your even aware of to be .
and loneliness need also practice , to talk about to do .
and this exercise we do have all do n't .
we have neither the language , we have signs for ourselves to recognize when we are lonely ?
you have to one two <unk> , which , i keep me .
the one part of humanity says , you is from beginning of lonely .
from birth to death is you actually just lonely .
it 's few moments in life where you that <unk> can .
these people go and often to <unk> and guide to the day off .
i did ' no time , is so you <unk> .
and then have people might be less <unk> say , all , is with everything connected .
that i it 's really did n't , so , i 's just a part of the big universe .
and there are the great group , to the , i am the time , so , just so imagine .
the thinking , okay , today i 'm feeling lonely and the day , oh , it depends on yet all together , together .
if we of loneliness think drops to the first of the very big one a a .
the one of dying , the one of another person on an icu .
but these <unk> , about these large <unk> <unk> ' i actually did n't talk , but i want to talk about the small , about the mundane <unk> , where one 's also in such a theater we can .
i also want to do n't talk about burden and <unk> of <unk> .
one in other determine when we usually not difficult one with us to <unk> already .
the photographer christie reaching tailors , in the break a few photos taken , i show you want .
how easy it 's always land , in other loneliness to .
and we all know , not whether these people to really that moment , lonely have felt .
but who 's n't it , the moment on this <unk> event where you think , all talk together , just you yourself is something lost in the corner and has anybody to <unk> .
this sudden <unk> loneliness know about safe here all .
may have some they also now been seen .
what you this to do you put the mobile phone out very often , and that you could now very good at this is that <unk> , that <unk> on the mobile also an escape , the <unk> .
this visible , if you on the display look .
what we now here do n't .
yes , and then there 's the one , the types of them is the one of a <unk> on <unk> stage hundreds of <unk> faces in a and you even something out in the hope , you with text not forget .
this is the <unk> , you the outside of seeing .
that we other people attach .
but i 'm sure , there 's also people in the room , and from birth of lonely feel that all their lives for so spent have , by you have tried , this one of the <unk> , to distract them .
and there are in this room guaranteed , people who are feeling lonely , because they 're on a different people up to be it because of death or because of a separation .
there 's using it , nothing , that still so many people , even people with , which they 're connected in , around them are you feel a lonely .
and there are people that have the relation to yourself lost find any contact more to , and are so lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital loneliness .
and sit down , you to the fairly analog loneliness .
the fairly analog loneliness is us familiar .
this is that people who after their opinion , it 's no , social contacts .
and that 's always relative .
it 's not official number , no <unk> number , whenever somebody enough human contact has , how do n't .
us down there , the old people a .
it 's the fairly analog form of loneliness .
since we but everybody in cities it connected with very many people at facebook or with twitter or facebook is this digital loneliness and bigger become .
you can with hundreds of people be connected , without with one people really connected to be .
it 's at the analog one more the so what of human relationships , the missing is it at the digital loneliness the quality of relationships .
the two forms of loneliness to be very often against each other <unk> .
this is also remember that the fairly analog one of a <unk> <unk> .
whereas the digital loneliness to a suitable for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it 's of it go that the digital one in the future , gain is when the ways that is to connect to be bigger .
i do n't know , whether you in 20 years that feeling that the our from loneliness very much will be , more loneliness call it .
or whether you do then a new word there .

almost even greater than the one yourself is that scared of loneliness and from this scared of loneliness is people a lot to do you have it .
<unk> , the great <unk> , also a <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
in that describes what she people do everything , and not just to be .
they build cathedrals , you witness the kids who then again , lonely and are alone .
but that <unk> did n't they named in the afraid of loneliness to dislodge , which is spend money .
shop go .
things acquire .
both the process <unk> , for the one , because it at least short term a touch them as well as the objects themselves , you acquired , did .
only problem is that it 's very quickly help and stops , that this <unk> against the one .
so we must always , new things buy us to <unk> .
i did ' time that ad for a a <unk> panties label seen .
and the <unk> really quite a <unk> of mobile phone communicate with the idea be an of it .
what that in our underpants has to do , do n't know , but apparently can also that .
one has so nothing with the <unk> to do one finds of people like this right instead .
<unk> <unk> has a wonderful poem written , and there is a verse , the worst is the loneliness to <unk> .
hand on it 's heart , who knows that not ?
in a relationship <unk> or the or the other at <unk> to see and a sudden really just to feel , really lonely to feel and the question to imagine , who is this person actually ?
did i with the first place to do something ?
a study this says that to the <unk> women in the their 40s , married with kids that feeling .
reference do n't have , because i have been not more know , if i the study that even 've invented that often did i they told .

that that intuitive way totally course , is almost have a <unk> .
loneliness to <unk> is any <unk> and yet we speak not about them .
talk just as little bit about the one at sex .
and that has probably already has experienced .
even as you <unk> is a sudden to think , what do , i here is actually ?
who is that person in my bed , in fact ?
and that a form of loneliness that not really do what must have with the quality of sexual way .
but nothing to do must have with the quality of relationship .
it 's just always there .
we speak only do n't about them , because we do n't look at .
we speak only are not about it in the workforce .
in the workforce is the one , <unk> when we think .
i stood <unk> on this <unk> <unk> and i 've seen a group of five <unk> , better said , three , carrying suit and two carrying costume .
the two men have to speak , the two women in the costume have a conversation .
and in between was something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> in your hands of <unk> .
i believe that one , i need to you the scene did n't going to do so you that form of loneliness that everybody , here has been in his a career has experienced , <unk> can .
it 's the the one of <unk> .
it 's also the one of <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see , sitting there may also some of their lives <unk> to <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> into hotels in , generic bars that often do n't know more , who they 're actually , what they do .
where they are , where you wake up .
and that 's a form of loneliness , about the not talking about it .
just so it 's also <unk> , like loneliness than <unk> to misuse it .
<unk> is here insulation .
i have time a <unk> told him , called was from a client , and the has said , it 's what 's then happened , you can do it do n't you imagine .
a <unk> was just in the lunchroom .
so he have to itself to <unk> provided .
and two months later he 's also stepped .
the one does n't just so .
she 's always in connection with other feelings .
she 's beautiful siblings and it 's ugly siblings .
the ugly boys ; we all .
fear , sadness in despair about anger and the shame .
but we should also the beautiful siblings n't forget .
freedom that the proud of the desire that <unk> .
so my plea , look at the one in .
come and goes in life as tide , and a flood .
you make them to and let you do n't of you push .
because there 's something much worse than the loneliness and this is the empty , that perhaps , of loneliness is if you do nothing more senses .
one is part of life .
since i so hard about one thought 've got to me two things change .
for a in my <unk> the <unk> i no longer as a <unk> dictator since i realized was that i only then always somebody who called , why he 's not touch because i thought , maybe <unk> i the people , maybe you 'll ' i lonely .
i it 's been able , since i the one in my life accepted , people come and go to make .
just as it 's with the <unk> , you like power .
also because i 'm free become .
people come and go to let , they no longer immediately to track , whether it from an encounter a friendship or even a partnership they could .
as a child , i found my parents an embarrassing .
the able to do n't <unk> go by without with somebody a conversation begin .
if in the <unk> or in business .
every time , it to limitless talking .
as a child , i found that so as i embarrassed .
as young adult i did it 's incredible for <unk> that to do this openness to have .
but first ever since i 'm way myself with the one has got to get it me at least , and again , i also <unk> like to open .
you see how lonely be called to be willing to do for the next occurs .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i did , here three seem in .
a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now ask , i you if you just once accessing ban the appearances they would take ?
the most would be for the <unk> decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we with the slightest effort the biggest impact of .
at health we do this kind of different .
because we let the activity with the biggest impact , except for eight and make us for other strategy .
we choose to us for example for the <unk> and the stands for sports .
big <unk> but big effort .
for me why not so valuable .
or we choose to us for the <unk> .
the stands for diet .
also very large <unk> but still very big effort .
for me and also not so valuable .
and i want you today about how you with the slightest effort the largest <unk> outcomes .
and when you to prevention and health busy , you get to a subject does n't you sit there .
and the issue is overweight .
and the issue overweight was in germany long time not a topic , so about until the <unk> .
and then joined in the number of obese people in germany has to .
and i was asked me , what it was going on in the <unk> ?
why was like this soaring suddenly , up ?
and then i did research and i 'm also <unk> become .
because it was exactly the years <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> to germany .
and we 're always and the thicker ?
and i did n't stop looking .
<unk> comes <unk> to germany .
and that obesity go up .

and what 's then to germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how all that means .
and we 're always and the thicker ?
well , then i was one , and one <unk> .
because it was there is clear .
sports is thick .
and of course <unk> ' i not here today , in them to say that exercise dick 's doing .
because that 's not true .
but one have now we 'd found .
the tide of the new now -- and <unk> n't have to lead , we <unk> and healthier to .
what it 's so then ?
the diet ?
and also there is it ai very good study from the states .
that , the have the problem with obesity .
and they have in the <unk> <unk> introduced .
and then they wanted to shortly after see what happened there really ?
and they 've seen , the people take in fact , less fat on but people taking too , and fewer calories to be but nevertheless , the thicker .
and it was the paradox .
and so you have it <unk> called .
we can you explain that ?
there are you to the body as a power station imagine .
here we here 's just big <unk> .
and on the one side is a <unk> , because we do all the <unk> on it , the be here is burned .
and here is the energy <unk> when electricity .
if we now , however , more <unk> here in giving in our power than we 're on the other hand , they consume <unk> , the energy in power station and it is 'pow .
the human body does n't matter 'pow .
the can energy that store .
and it in form of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
what happened though when we 're less as we 've heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> to this energy that then makes it just a conclusion that .
the <unk> has to drastically reduces .
here 's ever had no life more than .
we 're yes , just mobile .
and this is what happens .
our grandparents are <unk> yet 20 kilometers to walk gone .
and we come today , once on one to two miles and that are the positive estimates .
it 's the studies that report of five -- until <unk> feet .
i <unk> ' you that something more <unk> with my friend mike tell .
you giving these my degrees ' the chair ?
mike , you come degrees ' time ?
mike 's an american .
he 's shy , he wo n't talk too much .
and he was then at this trial , and sitting now .
he 's this typical <unk> <unk> , for <unk> <unk> and he 's a <unk> in your hands .
and mike eating and fewer and and fewer and take all we <unk> , and yet it 'll always and the thicker .
why ?
because mike , just sitting .
and i was time , just tracking how much exercise mike so at the day , and got him just so one step counter the back in the bag set and the night i was back <unk> .
and there stood on a thousand steps .
that is the distance , that mike at has in the kitchen countertop to the car with the car into the office there of course of a coffee , and night back again .
and he came on a thousand steps .
which means that mike was on this day 10 minutes on its legs .
<unk> hours and fifty minutes was mike , or was mike .
under those conditions of disease by itself .
and mike 's not so therefore fat , because he too much eating because so long it up and again , energy <unk> this but not used he will inevitably the thicker , and the energy <unk> to .
and first <unk> , the energy , you see here at his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> , that is not there .
the <unk> , and back in <unk> blood .
and also because it 's active and <unk> calm and quiet in his <unk> .
so the <unk> .
so when the energy <unk> into the blood , then talking about the physicians of high <unk> and high <unk> .
and this <unk> , the <unk> there as <unk> , makes all around little holes in this <unk> .
and a fortune floating there 's all the ones around and it up against well , you about these little wounds and we speak of <unk> or <unk> .
and now comes <unk> heart right under pressure , because need now he the blood of these tight <unk> jars pumps and we talk from high .
and if this high then on such a <unk> 's true , then makes it 's also the body 'pow .
and if that on the heart is happening , then we call the heart attack .
and if that in mind happens then we call the stroke .
and also in germany dies every second one of heart attack and stroke .
this is , in germany dies every second to <unk> .
and also mike gets so not so sick because it any exercise is driving it because it to do n't even more moved .
and if you this context not know , then you find whatever in the wrong spot .
for example , on diet .
i have degrees ' yesterday , a diet , the amazon into and there are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , much .
and if each book so just a inches thick is and we would the here <unk> , if we have a 30 feet high tower recent <unk> <unk> .
and i have the time for you read all .
and there is inside and now this is really matter if you more energy goes in so more food as they consume and then you will be thick .
and if you less energy goes in when they consume and then you will be thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why we need to <unk> books ?
that itâ€™s just a conclusion that .
the need course is huge but <unk> is to do n't help .
because why have failure a diet to a hundred percent ?
because it a diet is and not a lifestyle .
what 're using the things that , that we here 's for three weeks going to do and here 's five weeks ago when we then , after this struggle , again in the normal life back , to our ordinary life .
what we then actually , after five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
except <unk> and then an in the confidence , we again , not done that have what we have done have .
so therefore , you off now with any new diet , with any new <unk> questions do and you want to this in their day-to-day , in their life into .
yes or no ?
and when i then <unk> .
and if not let 's just stay .
because if the end of anything out , it 's the time .
it 's the habits that you decide whether we 're sick to or stay healthy .
it 's the bad habits , that 's ill do .
and it 's the good habits of us healthy do .
and if mike in the looking at then see it 's the result of everyday lifestyle .
if mike in the looking at , then see it 's your everyday habits .
and if mike in the looking at honest and to it 's , then what he also , where it coming which is .
because when he more bad habits as good , then it 's just into the disease way .
and if mike in the way to toward health direction of its goals , kind of its dreams , does n't he immediately be whole life change .
then it does he simply just more bad habits as bad .
and a and talking about habits mike 's also a great example of that human been a weird animal is .
mike , it for example done , moving out completely his life <unk> by it every way to the car , every <unk> uses , who actually uses .
and night and he <unk> on the couches and to sort of <unk> again to wave comes .
so is he is in his <unk> goes into the gym where with the <unk> to up what i do se a paradox is and then how it ai rat back on such a band <unk> , so he sort of back to wave comes .
and my grandpa have to just as amused as you .
the was farmer and the would that did n't understand .
the would have said , sport is for people that do n't move .
and somehow he 's also , right .
why we need at night in our precious leisure time that them what we in everyday life <unk> have ?
classified , we have today with this <unk> lifestyle two hours sports make a day .
and if only , but much easier the movement , there to find where we you lose .
in everyday life .
and so <unk> ' today i to a shifting our perspective invite men .

and what you look like a program computers that <unk> in us is .
we want to be the range of walking .
we plan our homes so that we the <unk> ways we have .
we plan our lives so that we the <unk> ways , but that brings us do they get there , where we <unk> .
but in a very different direction .
so get to them off now the <unk> activate and the movement , there 's , where they 've been up .
i out , like , like with the track .
and i 'm the only , of all up and down and up and down walks and everybody else away .
but if i mean here has been there 'm then <unk> ' i mean the time for me .
then <unk> ' i mean the movement of a , that 's easy way around it .
and if of up the announcement up , 30 minutes <unk> , say , i <unk> .
<unk> steps .
that 's about three times 10 minutes translation .
and a and talking about <unk> steps if you off now every day <unk> steps more go then it means , they the end of the day 12 of fat not in your body <unk> .
this may be relatively little sound .
but as <unk> , as a habit established , just <unk> days the year , then we speak of four point five pounds fat .
that we 're not in our bodies have .
and you give me degrees ' time that , i <unk> , it always <unk> .
the americans are there is crazy , the places like what this .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
they get ' i four pounds .
just so you ever sees , what happened there with these little steps .
and if that the effect is from this shifting our perspective , what you mean , what do n't happen if you really in an active life from now .
and these <unk> the get them to go from now every day in their day-to-day .
once it at <unk> steps per day got these are , walk you virtually all <unk> it .
and if you and lust , and have time in sports and then they do that on top .
they then next to the <unk> also still <unk> .
then they will also even faster and stronger .
but that they make your health not more dependent on of sport .
so they make your health not more dependent on from their lust , and from your time .
because the most important that most important that they 're doing now every day as a lifestyle .
and i <unk> ' an active life <unk> .
and for me it 's now more than a lifestyle , for me it 's a <unk> that on a clear decision based for life and for myself .
because i think , health has not to do with , what we should do or have to do .
but health has to do with , what we want to do .
and so <unk> ' i now , just an idea for them .
you decide to go from now just , just for best .
and off now you know , as it goes .
step for me step .
thank you .
<unk> how it has a leonardo da vinci , actually managed to this incredible , <unk> way of the world with other way to see ?
and it to itself so far on that engage in this , what to his time just simply inconceivable , never thought was ?
we could that also now ?
that , maybe what do with companies to do ?
and how we can it into force and confidence to our future draw ?
we start but time on , you with the question what do we actually of innovation ?
right .
technology inventions research and development , even the official <unk> the federal government 's titled <unk> the federal government .
so they get me right .
well that 's all great .
and we can with quite proud to be and be grateful that we <unk> in such a field is that our technologies around the world to be that it 's fine with it goes .
that we make a this extraordinary , unique wealth have evolved .
but how it looks with the future ?
that are challenges are you as a society , to us to ?
and who care of because there to the large environmental and social challenges ?
so <unk> , it seems kind of mattered to be .
a kind <unk> .
so the economy care of around the environmental challenges because the entrepreneurs and big effort to the we then productivity and efficiency field .
and the the world better to do the find in the nonprofit organizations and together and <unk> and the need to then also what do so thing non-profits of course , and then the damage the capitalist economy to remove .
at least <unk> to fix .
but who says because that we all that as such separated at need ?
how about it because if we our <unk> to just social and cultural dimension you ?
if technological innovation at once again , cultural innovation are ?
if more innovation at once again , social innovation are ?
if it 's <unk> <unk> thinking and doing sent to self-assemble with the solution large environmental and social challenges ?
if it very different people have unknown forces <unk> and if it 's <unk> a very different , fair <unk> to promote ?
because what was that ?
both sides to but what companies , right ?
can we do it ?
and ask you 're .
so far we have the yes , as with a .
fortunately , there 's encouraging examples .
pioneered by muhammad yunus shared , with his <unk> , with his as in bangladesh creepy much does to the poverty there <unk> .
and interestingly , too much more just in direct <unk> to with what the federal <unk> job .
and he 's <unk> as entrepreneurs , i realized that the nobel peace prize <unk> get .
at the opportunity because for me a i <unk> ' they still with anyone familiar do .
would like , i must imagine andrÃ© <unk> .
'n very <unk> young guy .
all trained , has , but also your ideal from capsizing .
and well , so totally <unk> .
i love the totally happy to .
and if you the see , then you think what do real , at the offspring , because we need to us to our future i do n't worry .
yes , right after the studying , he then here somewhere started to work at one our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it does he also very good .
that they like him , and there 's also very successful .
and yet , something out there have so in him .
so he asks , there 's not even more , this kind of in me out ?
so that this entrepreneurial he says , whatever .
companies are , in all <unk> .
and that they like him too .
and he enjoyed , these <unk> .
so the right there , the <unk> , the did he is equal in people .
so not that he it personally know , but so from <unk> tells him the , what .
and since the in the center at the t three n the knew he does n't .
so even more than he was surprised when the he then the <unk> personally imagined was .
when mister <unk> .
and as 'n an accomplished who has , he then there imagined .
that 's great pleasure raises , so with young people work together , there his his experience passing .
and the two , then by whatever it .
and have to be more met .
how about it because if we 're just so in one of these conversations from the two times <unk> ?
yes , mister <unk> , so what was that because again right .

that i still not quite understand .
yes , so , andrÃ© then we start , times in at the question what 's 'n <unk> company ?
so name says , itâ€™s already .
broad markets , broad products , broad customers , broad structures , there 's a <unk> .
and you can also quite right prediction from giving , where , the great things <unk> .
and it ai ai <unk> , even if the way he 's it can also one .
what 's because then actually a <unk> ?
so , andrÃ© , you <unk> been so one is it 's just does n't guarantee it 's just not the small copy of a big business .
it 's something else .
it has itâ€™s an entirely different character .
because it 's got hold anything <unk> .

of why is a <unk> a an organization that the purpose is a business model to look , to find , to develop the profitable is , of course , that but most <unk> is and then scale it .
and you will certainly understand that it , in so <unk> organization very different very different ways of thinking there , very different <unk> , very different ways .
yes , it 's i 've been obvious .
but after what we look for because actually ?
so , i jump ' time , then it goes straight because you can <unk> <unk> to make money right ?
so i did , there , degrees , it fits quite well , so 'n seminar found in berlin would you me that recommend it ?
that is <unk> .
you how your businesses are successful <unk> and after the <unk> your life for <unk> did .
oh no .
really <unk> ?
what do you think because if you with the 30 your <unk> money did what 's because after that your <unk> ?
so <unk> you then a career as <unk> <unk> or what ?
what happens then with your commitment , like i know you ?
and also , so let 's but let 's the <unk> in .
so the statistics of <unk> give you do n't <unk> perspective , because seventy percent of <unk> are few years before it in a lot <unk> financial situation when front of their big going .
it 's always the result of a successful company and of a good community-led business .
right , money is an energy source to engage <unk> .
and it the basis of all economic <unk> .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , which is then the goal ?
the company ?
so , if i what had ' i did , but learned , so without goal is no way the right .
and so , going to have yet , and then measurable in time may be and so forth .
and when i all that 's not have ' , so that as i can looking for something of that i did n't know what i seek to ?
so that i do n't feel good .
so how do i because there are and and actually go into it feels to me anything like you know , and inherently uncertain of .
yes , andrÃ© welcome to the engage .
but i did , there may what for you .
a thread .
so the is yes , <unk> , so almost a secret .
successful <unk> of generation to generation <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , or as you say today ?
<unk> get ' i , <unk> ?
so we say stop and <unk> it .
with immediate crises and <unk> and <unk> placing uncertainty .
so does guaranteed .
i believe that one ' , i can you one of these are leaving .
okay .
yes , thanks , mister <unk> .
but there are itâ€™s just ask it on .
that can you through the same time you one of the engage qualities 's good question to imagine .
that we can just one after the other through , i that may be better understand ?
so the first is what i 'm here and what i want you do ?
yes , andrÃ© , because it goes <unk> what drives you that about you thinking , that 's bigger than you yourself ?
what <unk> you in the world ?
what people have them , if you with you work ?
what you 're willing to be ?
what are your mind , perhaps , as unconscious <unk> ?
why is this so important that to see ?
because that 's also your engage <unk> .
and how we have the of learn ?
if you a ship build want to go then <unk> not the men together parts of a hot them on wood to collect it teach them , yearning for the broad , an unending sea .
yes , well .
so then <unk> i let me the next questions for .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
what does that ?
yes , andrÃ© now think you can your goal really ever conceived .
actually could color in detail , <unk> but i <unk> ' you in front of a if you 'll <unk> , what you do n't want to go then it going to you 're staying .
know you actually the story with the pink elephants ?
for me there degrees a .
not ?
<unk> .
so , watch out time on .
reset your time a pink elephants in front .
okay ?
does it 's been ?
so a pink elephants .
they figured out ?
no pink elephants .
you see ?
so it goes us , if we us so on focus on that what we do n't want .
what 's because actually the only way ?
because focusing <unk> ?
yes , right , imagine , to this of what you want .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the <unk> on the <unk> .
but imagine what you about before .
incidentally , what i just can you like , <unk> right ?
i did , you you a brought .
<unk> time , if you the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in this <unk> <unk> lord smith .
who ?
at <unk> <unk> <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> serious issue .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time is is <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the am considering majoring <unk> .
i what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> lady smith .

madam as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you one <unk> adversity do <unk> <unk> may is <unk> .

it 's <unk> a matter of <unk> .

and andrÃ© how does it from ?
is to which noticed ?
it 's something changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower , too .
okay .
so , then we look at some time , then we look at times where the bear with is .
and action .
<unk> <unk> in this <unk> <unk> lord smith .
who ?
at <unk> <unk> <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> serious issue .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time is is <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the am considering majoring <unk> .
i what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> lady smith .
and andrÃ© , how are you that ?
so , i know yet , i was also shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i the first time 've got . ''
i thought it can i do n't think was being .
and even more shocking , i was as me through the head into is there might be that i actually the time that way through the area over ?
by my life .
and okay , i do you do that yes , meaning .
and up there the immediate <unk> to prevent that we the most of our perception and our <unk> first <unk> need .
but what 's because now actually wearing ?
what jump , i was and what <unk> ' i from ?
and therefore andrÃ© , note to your perception in in some place <unk> to do , is just another important an entrepreneurial quality .
well , yes , thanks , then we get some time to the next question .
how i could actually to my goal come ?
so , that i think just good question .
it 's like , i me because every time , and do somehow not going forward .
yes , andrÃ© , there is it ai good news for you .
that 's going to easier to fall when you that may have been <unk> did .
because if you through your destiny is clear , your inner drive and if you 'll 'n concrete goal really about introduced to do i promise you , it 's inside there of happen by themselves .
almost automatically .
you will not all else can than that a brainstorming , you going on , that stuff on you coming up .
that are then these famous <unk> , that you wake of the shower did .
and there ai question recommend i 'll at the shoes off you well , and who are you integrate could who are you asking for advice could and there more input , more at with home to get .
and you 've also a huge role model .
the <unk> have this is very well <unk> .
<unk> di <unk> , if the not more on knew , has the in his <unk> invited in florence .
to lunch at the famous big table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politician , bankers , as traders engineers , architect and he 's just very intense <unk> being cared for .
but not in our modern day sense , where it you went , yes , who is , through ?
who 's right ?
but rather to that all of these different <unk> things came out that are so on any way of one of them alone could have to come up with can .
well , yes , the next question is the concrete next step i do ?
andrÃ© there are doing it 's successful entrepreneur in the reason really easy .
instead of to plan and management and so on focus , they always easy only on the next step .
because what do you because in the realm of uncertainty , do ?
but the run this really determined and with the consequence out .
and if it then nothing was well , dan look for them to stop <unk> different step .
and even if the big , colorful <unk> <unk> nothing was then there 's hold just another .
so it 's so important that you through your aid is clear .
this is to the inside safe .
and by the way as we actually have all have learned ?
although we that i did n't know , and it , nobody has said ?
-- you say there , <unk> with kids .
so , this play learning , this search and this <unk> play for it 's also , that 's fun doing that in a company is happening in a <unk> .
and that 's also just sort of the <unk> against the uncertainty us , otherwise , so <unk> power .
yes , thanks , mister <unk> .
so this sounds , itâ€™s already quite nice to .
but i 'm not so , with me in the company , i believe that one , there have to have a lot of bosses who do something that there anything happens .
and myself for here in germany there 's always like this is a mood .
and i believe that one ' , there would have to the politicians one of anxiety , that the to change .
okay my boy , come time with .
how do here 's down to the water .
what do you think , how many people can you change ?
10 ?
10 thousand ?
ten million ?
look time here comes down .
and who you see ?
right , the .
this is the the you change can , the you really change can .
or about it by mahatma <unk> to say for the change , that you in the world were looking for in your own .
do you think sure beautiful words and huge role models , but how to this because it work ?
because we have to happiness , 'n few <unk> on our <unk> .

and if you you in these situations should ask what excites you now despite all ask , you that stance you take can physically for you powerful to feel .
ask , you some time , what you to <unk> like , over the you 'll just <unk> .
and all the end , ask , you , what you actually from this recession or with what bad happened is because did .
so i my , if it frightens you already happening is that it 's at least was totally worth it .
yeah well .
mister <unk> thank you .
and do you think really that me that 's on my engage way ?
itâ€™s true .
and my out of all two things .
first time eighth on the clarity your inner <unk> , that then to your engage what will .
because that determines your perception .
and second , eighth to your inner attitude to themselves .
because it <unk> you like the other people , to you behave .
future is always just then when we our own change perceptions .
<unk> you to this to ?
yes , i can think , already .
thank you mister <unk> well then .
all good andrÃ© <unk> .
yes .
what do you think of our andrÃ© ?
nice .
really , or , <unk> ?
and how we hold it because now , with this <unk> ?
it 's a new <unk> ?
i mean , yeah .
very clear .
which i of all the <unk> see .
<unk> is <unk> hardly .
and this is that what the <unk> really is .
a <unk> from <unk> the euphoria .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
that is something of <unk> .
the right <unk> long been in the big famous name <unk> .
by robert bosch about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> or how they all hot .
let us , just those minds to animate .
and who knows might be yes out of our andrÃ© the next leonardo of our time .
you see right , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it was so obvious , i 'm with kids and their future <unk> because finally , yes children our future .
instead is that of view the i the most of time enjoy .
i 've spent a great deal of my life in prison .
in four years have my father and i the program <unk> , entrepreneurship for prisoners , created .
we is <unk> entrepreneurial , which means that they can be after the prison either on making or find to your left to spot a work the then they also can hold .
why <unk> i 'm so now , does to <unk> , so ones that has been thereby are the big mistake did ?
our program is much not so easy to see how programs that is about children care .
and actually had said i thought that the <unk> the last place in the universe is , where i work would .
what you think , is the most missing factor in childhood with people with that we work ?
we figured out , there are positive role models often male positive models .
and if you think about , why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> there are often it 's because it that the father no sensible work has that he drinks , he drugs consumed or that he himself in prison is .
and if you a <unk> young think about what it from his life like to make it 's perhaps not even better idea , as a different lives might look because he no better models , did .
and he <unk> his father for .
i <unk> ' you martin imagine .
martin 's <unk> of our program .
his father was alcoholic and made of the whole family 's lives the hell .
when he 12 was is his mother died , and he and be smaller brother had to go home .
there it was the <unk> the great .
he was shy and <unk> and so the perfect victims .
up until the day as being small brother at a <unk> so roughly <unk> 's been that this at the ground are stayed .
there transformers , martin the first time the <unk> through , he went on the other off and proposed to .
and from that day , he was respect .
and so it was going .
violence was part of now on to his life just as in his father .
how it goes well , the ones , i just described well , on ?
after the childhood , of adolescence are lots of unemployed or have <unk> .
you 've not much different than your illegal activities and their <unk> <unk> .
and then they will one day with people to prison closed where it 's what this is , their thoughts about the same thing around the also not a better models are .
about what , you think , think these people together to , if you together in prison are ?
mostly about not much good .
and they get better criminals are in <unk> .
they sell a drug on a higher level and 're still in the prison where you after the prison <unk> could .
and this thing is then in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .
this is , in germany will all convicted second criminals to go back .
then there 's but also people in prison , and really change will .
but also these people wear a label on the forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere , where they come , is that your first building identity .
if you to a work for , if you to an apartment for whether they new private relations into want to wherever you will be with this identity , with this label face , of you one onto in the society that infinite hard power .
this is the problem , before the we are .
how we try this problem , to solve ?
the fact , you think , bringing lots <unk> with ?
they will be surprised .
it 's entrepreneurial skills .
who a <unk> 's built up , definitely know of <unk> , of <unk> and of <unk> .
on the subject <unk> it 's a little <unk> , otherwise something , he did n't in prison landed .
these characteristics we would for something positive use .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison , in three blocks .
we teach the basics of entrepreneurship and economics .
everyone to write its own <unk> and everybody 's taking on a comprehensive <unk> part .
and then with we the people , after the into custody at the <unk> , the <unk> at the <unk> your personal relations and also at one of <unk> .
what for <unk> go there from our program from ?
it 's a big range , from <unk> to the agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> and <unk> .
a very large bandwidth and to <unk> ' i you 'd like geoffrey imagine .
<unk> <unk> talent and his illusion of the rapid money , it has been very early , for trade with cocaine seduced by .
he had always been fun thing , businesses to do .
he 's then <unk> the first time arrested been .
and this prison , it not very impressed me .
quite the opposite .
he goes back on today , he was at its second later ready .
<unk> is he then the second time for been .
he took then only at a therapy part and then at <unk> .
and there was learned it as it be <unk> talent for something <unk> can use .
he 's in september 13 full-size them had been , has then october <unk> his agency for <unk> started .
the agency 's neat , he can now of life .
he has a very good <unk> out .
he 's now here with me .
who him to actually think to talk about them at him .
another time back to martin , of that i him to start telling had .
martin 's got to his childhood an education , chef <unk> and ended up in his play in the <unk> <unk> .
and because alcohol , and drugs there on the agenda are was his circle quite quickly started .
he was working along with a dj , and as a security guard from .
twenty years , he that life .
and he says today , he then with this life be not <unk> self-awareness <unk> has .
one day hurt it someone at a <unk> so hard that so he convicted was .
he took the <unk> part and that <unk> there 's really his life changed .
he learned how it to more force to more success and to more life could come with his air to into or without drugs to consume .
and he was of your knowledge so thrilled that he had decided that would like he would pass .
and he wanted part of <unk> to .
that has <unk> .
he works for now , two years ago at us and <unk> our participants in their way towards freedom , because he knows for ourselves that , and when you really change want and if you the right tools with at the hand get that much more is possible as you what i want .
the basis of these successes are actually people like you .
people that with us to prison , the to external past with us coming , in our participants in their <unk> , with your personal plans to consult .
that 's our <unk> , the <unk> talks into our lessons stop , this is that students that <unk> do , <unk> the <unk> do .
and that 's our mentors , that our participants right after the prison with .
and also these people take a lot of our program with .
one example .
we do on our past an exercise , and <unk> calls .
we 're then in the middle of space a big <unk> our participants are on the one and our an stand on the other side .
and i imagine then different question .
and every time , when someone in space that question with right answer is it at the time ago .
and here turns out , what we all together , , whether we within the prison sit or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and an example of this , where the differences are , is following question .
i 'm in a call social focal point up , i had a family member what i once in prison was .
there are usually very many of our participants in front of the line and very few of an .
a question , i 'd like for us , all together , the <unk> ' i 'd like you imagine .
and i appeal you that they all even get up .
maybe we a little light get the audience .
i can see them .
there are all .
well .
thank you .
i imagine , you one question and if you that question with right answer put them again , there , would remain just they are .
that 's sort of our our line , that we now move .
i have in my life which things done , for the i would have punished can be it was but not .
if you that question with right answer put them , please .
and to count , drunk car went to be .
and to count , maybe too small amounts <unk> obsessed to have .
and to count , it with the driving not to be just taken to have .
okay .
and it 's also that , maybe each does n't always completely accurate for to have .
all right .
the most of your seats .
we have a few angel in space .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you , you get , all over again sit down .
on this question , if we the on the past so , get our an very often to me thinking .
and many will also clear , how fortunate you may have had .
happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment in the they were growing up , with the friends but also very fortunate that , they may not going to get caught been are if you something on the edge of <unk> or even about it out to do .
what 's the result of our work ?
<unk> percent of our students get from within <unk> days after her left a work .
this is very quickly .
<unk> percent have to already is done .
a third of the donors are in the last year was <unk> .
and our <unk> lies at seven percent .
i did it already told the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany of <unk> percent of .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> per year , the base thirty thousand dollars .
and it 's a pretty <unk> , <unk> , what a <unk> of seven percent of a <unk> of typically <unk> percent for a massive saving means .

i was at my great <unk> in a big businesses are abandoned .
but i have to tell you , i was in my life , not as a <unk> work done .
we encourage our participants that , taking responsibility .
responsibility , which in your life 's happened and especially responsibility for to take , which in their lives will happen .
and not to hide , nothing to <unk> .
because that leads to a whole new self confidence and gives it , toward this again , trust you .
and therefore it makes me , especially happy and proud when our participants open of their way to report .
now i did you a little video brought .
movie , .
so i was convicted of two years and eight months because of dangerous <unk> .
i was because of <unk> against the <unk> to three years and 10 months convicted .
i have with <unk> traded .
so , i 've judgment of two years getting because of dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> it 's actually my whole life changed .
and what to me was important , was this <unk> , the , they do .
because there was my yes , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't <unk> , would ' i close to say , yes .
i 've got back goals of eyes feel .
i 've got another way discovered i 've got back , let 's just tracking .
and you go with a different awareness and confidence from the prison out .
so far it was always more <unk> n't fixed these goals and then is you hold in and anything <unk> .
with the wrong people together and that now not anymore .
well , the problem is that many no <unk> have , if that there .
that the biggest problem , because it 's automatically <unk> , you back in the old <unk> coming .
you know , nothing else .
by this <unk> individual coaching , whatever , which there are offered to have on , i just all my thinking about me for ourselves , about other , over the managing to problems , over the managing to the society , this is at me just as these two weeks completely around .
i 've been <unk> of my first woman who get divorced .
and since time six months good bye '' i again with it together .
that is so , we have a new relationship started .
and because i things i also by this whole <unk> and many other things change gotcha . ''
much did i already done .
i 'm with my family back in the raw the education started .
so i work today in my <unk> , would ' i say .
i do ' one right <unk> to <unk> .
you have that actually acknowledge , it very , very many people are the fact , like for example , my mentor now also about this time still out and actually about be yes , i do n't know , <unk> engagement beyond the people who approaches .
i 'm grateful for it , it on the idea at all got that are you so what do .
i 'm grateful for this is , they it , safe to trouble <unk> , and i 'm extremely grateful , i be part of for letting me .
and these of course , all the people , the support , who were about .
i was like i said with many people at the events which , and that i always , who have that 's good , that do . ''
and that 'll ' i 's also do .
and this thing , so thanks .
they come with us to prison .
each of you have something which we need can .
if you our participants in their <unk> up , if you as the <unk> to us get if they 're in the frame of a financial assistance 're about .
if you our program in a new <unk> carry want , very <unk> issue .
talking about it 's go on .
martin sebastian and i are here today .
and look forward to us on the conversation with .
thank you .
<unk> have , i <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> in nepal <unk> .
in a time in the i a way was .
there do you know these things .
and for <unk> for .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in convent take .
it 's right now actually many ways as you with dissatisfaction deal can .
more specifically as you dissatisfaction deal can .
anyway , i was <unk> the way .
with my work and so 'n bit with the <unk> .
which i here really of <unk> talk to .
and not from real problems .
my problem was i was <unk> and able to quite right conceived as my life in 10 two decades , 30 years will look like .
it was <unk> .
and these <unk> i found scary .
and it least to express .

for how privately .
i knew it does n't do i the <unk> way to happen ?
do it to me just really ?
or what if i mean <unk> again , throw ?
and look , what happened .
what then on me wait .
that were so the idea .
i was in that time free <unk> at a <unk> .
so as i <unk> .
the <unk> was for me , despite <unk> the absolute <unk> .
you <unk> free the world lives in very good hotels and <unk> the land on a very <unk> way of .
<unk> but occasionally , very <unk> countries .
developing countries where it sure anymore to see and say there than about <unk> with villages friendly <unk> local people that , though they do n't have , as luck and joy traveling .
right of these images and <unk> lives but a <unk> in a way too .
and so that was for me after a while the key quantity .
i was that what i did to some time .
to so .
and it was a little <unk> of me about a country to write to judge that i really did n't really know .
that i wanted to change .
i wanted to countries right out .
and <unk> writing articles to do .
and in my personal passion to quiet .
how you go countries are better know ?
by you with people living .
at the people living , on you home .
not in the hotel .
by you to the challenges and with the issues of people engaged .
and by you with people working .
at least that was the answer , i 'm on this question could be .
and that i wanted to do .
and i wanted something worthy do .
i wanted a can afford .
something do good .
and felt that has to with me , especially with a <unk> even further from .
i was that had been many times in developing world but nepal i was just particularly touched .
until <unk> was one there <unk> civil war of not just end orphans but also plenty economic and social problems left .
with a year per capita income of <unk> dollars is nepal the poorest country in asia .
and counting to continue to one of 20 poorest countries the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
nearly one-fifth of the population has to malnutrition .
forty percent of adults can not reading and writing .
all these facts are connected with very many personal stories and experiences , i on this journey had met me in a time in the i was willing and frankly , for change .
in the i even a difference to .
and drum up after my return out of nepal my decision that .
i quit my job .
and <unk> me at the aid .
and i <unk> ' now , just an excerpt of the answer <unk> the , i mean application received .
because they simply a <unk> was .
it 's here in a serious application in <unk> international by businesses .
and not for a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> the straight short time in nepal want to live and a funding of her visit addiction .
hi ?
it goes again ?
my application was really serious a well-intentioned and good .
at least i thought that .
and that answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really flat-lined .
and did , of course , a very emotional response to you .
and fortunately , never <unk> .
instead , did i this , right at sense , took about what good <unk> to do .
i did it used as a motor , in my own business to form .
<unk> .
heart <unk> and rising <unk> .
a company that basically just that provides what then i looked for have .
because the way , a country unlike to do .
the way , a country right know .
so i with people in place life and can work .
and not anywhere can work , but in going <unk> .
<unk> you can actually in two words be .
so karma , and <unk> .
that means much like , place in which you good karma can gather .
in which you do good can .
so this is now 'n little bit <unk> .
but it 's not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use tourism as a tool for sustainable development .
more specifically we 're using <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .



but they travel too simple way .
you live in <unk> .
and the main goal is not be a lot of recovery or in a lot <unk> but real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and <unk> .
and to engage in our participants and after <unk> and interests in various projects .
we can through our work for a <unk> tourism , regions in the otherwise , no chance to classical tourism have .
because just the any infrastructure to it 's missing .
the other we can be sustainable projects , .
we can own sustainable of gear -- and finance .
we pay for us so to a hundred percent itself .
also are not on to depend .
and this is us just for our long term residential development engagement of meaning .
now taking we have to our work <unk> in nepal .
<unk> year we our engagement in uganda <unk> .
and so after about four years turned to us now i 've got married and my husband and i are also for a team a <unk> question .
so let the <unk> way on ?
or what if we even greater thinking ?
if we the <unk> still going on this ?
if we with this not just social engagement and so travel my but development in your wholeness is ?
and so that , the individual <unk> integrate ?
or even specialty individual <unk> .
it would then actually in a new a an enterprise .
a company that , at companies do .
with other <unk> but the same culture like <unk> .
we want to this ?
was the next question .
'n new business ?
sure we want to this .
we love entrepreneur and their creative companies .
because we 're a ticking .
because we the same language talk .
because we the same dreams dreams .
because we the stakes now understand .
and why we year in <unk> one sister given .
<unk> .
and with <unk> and we 're creative companies in of development and start <unk> that we by really extraordinary people who approaches .
and part of we are the participants , who or staff of creative companies with an individual development <unk> .
so <unk> that the personal social and <unk> evolution of <unk> include .
and <unk> the on the <unk> prepare .
the there are at it <unk> also again .
one of the next to a meaningful <unk> another one more huge advantage has .
he shows a in relatively short time on where you 're standing or where you <unk> .
where you may still <unk> prejudice , did .
where you may to a flexible is to <unk> in thinking .
and he shows a on , what you really good is .
it 's a its strength of eyes .
was it the creativity , the sudden , terrific is .
or was it the serenity that you , in the discovered .
the serenity things just assume that you do n't can change .
and the force , things to change , you can change .
and you can very much change .
already in very long time .
we know that .
one of this .
this is that <unk> rose <unk> , lydia and <unk> .
that are five very wonderful women in uganda .
with sad <unk> and with art .
they engineer beautiful , <unk> <unk> for years .
and for years happened nothing .
because they simply no market for it had .
because they did n't know , as you the quality can improve .
because you nobody has said , what design may be in question is coming .
we wanted those women help .
and and therefore , in this year , a <unk> started .
<unk> <unk> product .
products that people of poverty , .
that you an income there .
a future possible .
we 're yesterday with our <unk> live out .
and begin with a first <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> of thousands <unk> of our women .
the sales get you do n't just for a year , an income .
it gives us as well , the project , a lot larger to do .
this first <unk> 's sort of social crowd <unk> and <unk> in a .
so who help me , can this for a with the purchase a chain do for others can it but with us either directly into the project travel .
he can to the women go and to actively <unk> .
long term we want to do n't just five women a work give it fifty or a hundred .
and not only in uganda , but also in nepal and in other <unk> , in which we <unk> work .
it is but this <unk> just a project from our integrated cycle on projects .
we 're working in the core areas .
in the area <unk> <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work in one field just to little bit is .
what happens to their kids when the women working ?
right .
so we have in this year in nepal and in uganda , two <unk> centre started .
it reaches into our cycle together .
and all that 's even more sense , as any one project for yourself .
collaborator we place and after <unk> in the different projects .
the exact opportunities are a then the only in the joint effort .
and finally , i want you now , right on a journey from .
and that i appeal to the eyes to close .
imagine , you , you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you sitting on a wooden dining room .
and are satisfied and tired of .
you 've just with your <unk> to had lunch .
there 's <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
in here it 's pleasurable warm .
you <unk> from the window .
and see kids in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet <unk> the sand on .
you <unk> to your <unk> .
also on them is a thin layer <unk> dust .
the children are laughing .
and calls for having your name .
you <unk> you that they will not just <unk> call .
<unk> .
you do n't know , what time it 's .
but soon you going to get up .
and the <unk> , on the right now the children are running , <unk> .
the end of the street is a big tree .
here you going to you with lydia meet .
in the meadow sitting in the shadows of the tree you will the new designs of their <unk> to talk about .
and as you will with my hands and feet talk .
later come in the other women this .
they smile you <unk> in .
until you with your english <unk> .
under the tree .
in free .
unbelievable , that here , internet is there .
this morning <unk> you back with your coach .
it <unk> you you .
the exchange is every time value .
it 's also very much time again , german to talk .
you 're hearing music .
and that <unk> of <unk> .
mom fiona is washing the courtyard the pots off .
they sing an african proverb song .
you 're sort and happy .
you can the way back to do .
one of us can the <unk> to express yourself on something new engage in this .
or at least for a short time that cube again news to throw .
and to look what happens .
thank you .
before i start , would interest me , whether of you tonight , that they 're here , has anybody stayed 'n house you have .
i <unk> , with the light n't really good , but perhaps want to someone up .
down here <unk> ' i you .
two .
here , up <unk> ' i 'm sorry ; not , but in any case , down there are here has been two , that 's beautiful , we 've been time to <unk> .
i did , which is also a building occupied and the ones villa mountain in the east of the city <unk> .
this is the building .
together with two other people did i the villa in the last summer , six months for you .
and so <unk> ' i today evening on here you .
well , and , like now some of you might say .
what is it 's also ?
<unk> there 's itâ€™s a lot .
but i want it quickly explain .
oh , what you used up now the villa ?
and you <unk> then the park or how ?
just , a variety of questions that as we know , friends , colleagues have asked when you have experienced , i part of an initiative with which i <unk> ' to , something <unk> name , <unk> am .
all expected , we us seamlessly in the number of <unk> <unk> had .
and here around these villa <unk> up had , <unk> impact and banner put up had .
and in order to the privatization of these villa to protesting .
but who i know , knows that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was also not the <unk> <unk> the initiative .
so what we see is a sign of the <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space , of you privately is , and so for many people are n't there is , <unk> ' i do n't say , but i just not in public hand is and why is n't be used can , you public spaces may 's .
we were a group of <unk> together in the desire to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , sensitive and sustainable to deal .
and we wanted a different <unk> tell .
we were a <unk> team and that i have now very quickly see , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas architecture , urban planning a social -- , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , music , photography <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
now , simultaneously , with different social cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspectives <unk> and <unk> to .
and have allowed us , in different skills but also in various networks <unk> .
and creative in part living unconventional solutions in the <unk> that we then did have , <unk> to do .
we 've actually navigated , the villa to occupy .
however , it 's about that we the villa with stories and ideas people .
we have to memories and been asked .
and out of those memories and images out to , to perspective for the villa to develop .
it was it 's important that the process and constructive remains .
us as initiative for itself , we do that always as <unk> platform and as <unk> terms .
this was <unk> a <unk> and emotional occupy and was , and after to a <unk> .
on the experience , that we do that have done , <unk> ' i now here tonight go into .
every city has <unk> places .
the a neighborhood a face to be .
in many cases , this , <unk> and who basically commercialized and be in the result of citizens by strangers places go invisible .
they are the dead -- a city because you just a lot not the equivalent to , what we in a public space expect .
so for example that we <unk> have , <unk> have .
are these , but also the fact , public , the urban places neglected , that will often <unk> .
initiatives , the places like back to , are often too <unk> interest already in the its infancy this .
what did it also with me to do , like here some questions , like some outside questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places give our town not just a face .
no .
they are the social places of our town , in the our social life is happening .
so do we there often first <unk> actually to our neighbors , if we look at random on the way to go shopping to meet .
and can these empathizing , if we just an ai to have , to sit , and we actually stop , if the spaces , designed accordingly are .
and we just 'n longer go have .
it into form friendships , sometimes .
but what safe to it 's a sense of community .
the more encounters i do that in such a public space , ' the faster and the more like it 's also that community .
and when i 'm not <unk> , then you 're just that what you probably the anonymous a major city called .
we were then , two challenges .
we can at the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood woken or in <unk> also <unk> to .
how can protest in creature be transformed ?
how can criticism in ideas be transformed ?
protest against the privatization , and genuine this <unk> <unk> places and criticism against the growing and actually not too which <unk> just the same places .
now , now , that they sit here , even before , they beat the newspaper on and read this text .
love empower and citizens , we invite you a we want you three possible options for the <unk> of <unk> imagine that a previously carefully <unk> <unk> designed .
you get the boat in the idea of a nuance choose .
and the alternative to the most <unk> is then <unk> implemented .
they would go ?
would anyone of them to that event going ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it does n't let 's great .
it 's just way , which <unk> .
they ca <unk> , like this in the future looks .
and as i said , does n't let 's wonderful about the first moment .
i try ' i still in an explanation .
and it , because i think , they ca n't actually really join the conversation , or pick or <unk> , <unk> .
all , because classic <unk> often too late to <unk> .
this is , usually have you do n't actually a chance , really your suggestions to make or some alternatives to argue , but it 's actually have just design and they ca <unk> yet to decide whether they <unk> or <unk> in the city green plants .
or , as a friend other day said , what color the trash , for example .
second one explanation classic <unk> 's rarely about information and vote out .
think of the three <unk> varieties .
we have here is what , that we want to show you and they must then going .
frustration and incomprehension are often the following what i also some way they think .
i certainly have to any decision about <unk> or <unk> meeting when i actually rather ai <unk> way where instead <unk> <unk> had had .
it 's but also different .
although we the <unk> the existing <unk> a lot of talking about , we have ultimately a lot <unk> experience .
and we have experience up and that i 'm going to others <unk> pieces .
i want it pass on other initiatives , of other projects , but also , or of all of the city group and at the policy .
because right ones that are , that these <unk> actually able to and the really responsible for these things are .
if which is really the interest in a participation is there , it so often by and out first is then we need and then you need to retrain them so new <unk> .
not least <unk> ' i 'm but also to you everybody who you here are .
and it 's therefore , because i <unk> for very important is .
i hold , it for important that they all go , and i want them with our example encourage , the <unk> still a chance to give .
and i <unk> me of them all , because you who are , the at the retrain them so a new <unk> demand it can .
so we have to participation look in , at the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood and got to participation and <unk> to hardly ?
one willingness to the dialogue in <unk> .
in <unk> come for professionals in <unk> , citizens on <unk> and different interests together .
so what we see is a <unk> , to the we invited to have .
so what we see are some <unk> and <unk> the conversation with citizens .
the goal to be , that all those conversations on <unk> take place , so , that not the <unk> interests or the <unk> skills about the skills of citizens are .
the citizens in place are experts , they 're experts to their neighborhood you know what you missing , which <unk> it with a place them , in which tradition in a place , and also what you a place is missing .
the <unk> , especially in the city can bring , what on <unk> level in the project into is to .
in alone or in in a particular case can then another <unk> be involved the issues enhancing , the right on the project tailored are , ever having .
all that leads to a <unk> , where all of information for all available , and the then the place something that can be .
by maybe even trace the can be , the an identification of their place to .
a dialogue in <unk> also means , the wishes of the locals actually taken seriously to .
and it 's also then , if somebody says , i want a <unk> next to the marketplace .
that can of course , complete on his , but the goal to be , in <unk> dialog with all right <unk> , which is the right solution and maybe in <unk> then also the <unk> getting , but maybe at a different place .
as i said , this has got out of the dialogue out and then they emerge .
second point is different ways <unk> .
our <unk> 's colorful .
one feels a completely comfortable , when he was going <unk> large group , and can talk .
a different can is good writing but let the text and n't going to <unk> large group talk .
a different draws you 'd better or photographing .
or building his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i 'm telling it has different <unk> give to different market up to be .
we have this instance the way , just to come , there to be , the first time , watch her , what happens .
the background just small exhibition .
we have here is the opportunity had , <unk> to give .
we have the opportunity had , to paint .
we have the opportunity had , to write .
regardless of the age .
this was a <unk> girl .
we had the way , our ideas with their faces to connect to play ideas to <unk> .
that , the way , outside of <unk> <unk> , to participate , should always been be .
that can for example of a <unk> happen , that can about <unk> <unk> happen .
the <unk> and transparent availability of the nurture the dialogue , the in them .
we even have the entire process in parallel on facebook with and on one of independent blog and the news <unk> about a <unk> distributed .
our third point <unk> .
they may remember that it i said that <unk> often too late to take place .
at my <unk> event there 's been three finished <unk> .
<unk> 's the process but only then when he early place and the retrain them so in ideally you even did n't even know what with <unk> area to happen to .
if through the dialogue , and so i 'm back to the point one has been , <unk> is , that are futures for an area in question come .
<unk> 's actually also for <unk> itself .
and it 's then , if not from beginning to be written is that the <unk> event like and so how did , but on the experiences from the previous self-assembles .
what happens now , if you having your city find and your city <unk> .
's already in numerous projects in .
i did , an example here from <unk> , this is the <unk> , is likely to , thank you know .
in new york was just a project launched , because it goes to a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> there are in six weeks <unk> dollars combined to the the funding for should do or at least <unk> .
the time has to in august wrote the policy could not different , as the idea to their own to do .
also the <unk> in new york , to the i believe that one , i no longer need to tell , because he has to one of the most important <unk> the city 's become was no idea of politics or administration .
in the opposite , the <unk> for the <unk> were already found .

the city was then told <unk> is n't necessary .
the four weeks <unk> , for the <unk> <unk> have , the rich , as <unk> out .
today the <unk> the city offline .
during the side <unk> d e step out and the city the <unk> , the the initiative , and there started , and other <unk> supported .
elsewhere paint having their own <unk> in the street .
in rotterdam in a <unk> footbridge erected .
everything well so far , you want now say .
then we do but now just like .
but i hold it for wrong , the city out of responsibility to make .
why ?
for a , because they did a look at for it all have or should have .
during the extreme , it be having initiatives , or businesses , in the rule on a for them in some form relevant part of focus has the city against the responsibility for projects that also on the edge of attention away .
and the other , even when the city the projects for , are other tools available to .
a <unk> initiative can this just <unk> or accept .
also our goal was actually a an initiative that after her graduate plan was roughly half a year working the results and the responsibility to the city to want .
current state a investor in the villa in january bought .
it go even when there .
so we have unfortunately , now in the problem , we the responsibility not yet it could .
but we know , to any case , already now , that when the city the villa successful <unk> , if the negotiation actually successful that are then a <unk> in this is .
in what form of being is , more open .
in the end to come i 'm convinced of , many projects that because of meaning , complexity or even their costs of the city designed to be a chance , happiness approval and identification to create .
if you just in time and in dialogue with the citizens <unk> to .
in each of city and citizens .
in each of city and you all , that you today tonight sitting there .
if we our in maintaining and at the policymakers the <unk> of citizens do n't more than an inconvenience well , but as <unk> .
it 's that .
last night , the <unk> we were here in <unk> in <unk> and are so the <unk> did .
we have over <unk> talked .
so that this idea , there ai second chance to have , if it in this life does n't <unk> has , then just another time , ai second chance .
we found quite exciting .
and we were but relatively quickly to agree that 's two things there , that we do n't have ever experiencing wanted .
this one is the puberty .
second thing that there was also , right scale at the table , another time in the school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you may remember , <unk> out <unk> .
at me is it , so now this is that <unk> years ago , but the words , at me , to <unk> hands .
my neck woman straps herself to together and i just want back on it <unk> .
and then do n't know , how it at them was but in my exams was then all of the that with the <unk> taken seriously , did , the was always beside me .
no idea what out of that actually has gotten .
they 're going to understand it , so , my high school was n't really beautiful and after i then my final <unk> behind me had was perfectly clear , never again school .
and what is now i say when i on the year <unk> look back some of the nicest day , i there spent , ' , did i in schools spent .
with great ecstasy and completely for free .
how did it on that ?
how could it happen ?
it just started , so on , that something happened , i do n't even know could .
i got kids .
so , my wife had the children .
and that was then also very clear that you who is , and to this <unk> to deal was .
up until the one day , when she said , treasure it 's <unk> .
and now you go down .
yes , <unk> .
because i opened the door and then i sat there put in this <unk> and whoa , i felt me <unk> in the <unk> .
it looked like this right out there , it back with us basically .
and that , even more like it is like school at smelly , and i <unk> ' me , human being here , and itâ€™s really a failure changed .
and when i then the teacher , you heard and you know , the children learn not for school , but for 's live there <unk> ' i me , oh my god , the sentence did i mean when i do n't <unk> .
what is that what we from school , from this high school in fact , for 's life really up have ?
so many of us have <unk> there really well learned .
where they 've actually in your life <unk> here has been really good to do ?
and maybe you know some yet , like the capital from yugoslavia means .
what 's another time yugoslavia .
or <unk> , that capacity in short time in a lot of knowledge in the <unk> , just , so i , it on button again <unk> can , to me at it ?
well , i did , the time needed for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what does a <unk> of one point one about it out whether someone 's a good doctor 's going ?
if the <unk> is and if the good diagnostic functions properties have ?
no way .
so , no way , for 's life , not for school we learn .
if we so look back , so roughly <unk> years , middle of <unk> century , there like that i voted have .
this is the time , in the in germany the <unk> then eventually completely was introduced .
and where also the school system , how we it today , , its roots , did .
and if we have the time now imagine , then there was actually so , the people then the had no access to know your time .
and there were these four or six years , the put them to have been , in the school to go and with knowledge of been that were then actually the only way , the that had in , with the knowledge and the facts and the information of their time in touch to come .
today has a <unk> more information in his pocket as the biggest library of that time .
and middle of <unk> century , that was the time the industrialization .
this is , there things have changed in the world and there were suddenly humans need , that these new machines have to .
simultaneously , but also people needs , that these machines wait and repair could .
and we needed people that these machines 're able to and that those factories were .
may recognize it 's been .
this <unk> school system , that we now in germany , thank you still have , has its root in that time .
and has there might point did .
also because it was probably really that was , that what i in school and learned was , for work at the assembly line , you who at the assembly line up , the state be there for life .
we do <unk> zoom in the future .


i was with my very finished and thought , now is the moment , now do you know their own , the first company .
yes , after some to me around with this web , then <unk> ' i , then <unk> ' i that now also time out .
and some corporations are at us <unk> and always been bigger and the bigger , and we are beautiful slow grown , and some of the companies are then at us again , so in which case <unk> .
you see is always two times in life .
and we had then after some years ago , 30 staff .
so , we had such a beautiful growth and we had so exciting careers on board like <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know , if you ai concrete idea have what these people do but when i in the school , we had no idea that it so what ever give would .
even when i <unk> did was of so what like the internet still not talk .
and the kids , that we now in the school to believe the job to the in 10 , fifteen , twenty or 30 years have ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and which know the facts are the need in , in those future jobs to succeed be ?
and if you 're honest , there too the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 've been so in the future looking out who could me because the <unk> for the saturday give .
it 's <unk> <unk> , did i read .
well , you see , they have no idea .
how do we then out , which school for 's lives learning it ?
what are the things that we need , about children for 's life unfit to do ?
and maybe help from such a look at in in that what businesses today , they 're looking .
that this is that itâ€™s the <unk> of school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and universities are coming then in the company .
and if you , so just a <unk> look at right , then is there at first place , yeah , so what , like the expertise .
there to the yes , so the reading and then so , we 're looking <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and of 12 years in offshore .
this is going to school , and also in the future can not afford .
what school but yet afford could , are the things that always important to this , that are so called <unk> <unk> and i am firmly of that convinced that these <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the future will be .
and that you can in principle into three groups summarize .
this is for a , do want to employees , the flexible are , so , flexibility 's one .
and then they want to almost all their employees with <unk> thinking .
and then you want to these companies collaborators , the <unk> are .
so we built <unk> think and <unk> .
we start with the flexibility in .
this is relatively quickly comprehend .
if we look at , as business now working , how fast , yes , how fast , everything is changing .
<unk> , yes whole business models are the internet of today on this morning on the its head .
and practice , i collaborators , the with this change can deal .
and practice , i collaborators , that are creative .
and practice , i collaborators , the <unk> are .
it 's pretty just the opposite of what in the factory end of <unk> century of staff at the assembly line it had .
also the second issue that entrepreneurial think is quite clear .
because it goes around the responsibility .
because it goes to people that take responsibility .
first time for yourself and their own life .
but also for the big thing .
if that now the company is or even when society wish we have people who take responsibility for the big thing .
and the third factor , the <unk> , that 's almost at the most <unk> .
and if we look at the football world cup remember , then there was there 's the web this beautiful saying .
argentina , <unk> <unk> portugal , <unk> and germany has a team .
it was n't geoffrey <unk> , of the world cup have made .
that could the only together make .
and so somebody , this big innovator who our time , steve jobs , yes , <unk> .
it was not the , of the iphone have invented , the has not the <unk> invented , the has itunes n't invented , the has nothing of that invented .
the had a team that this possible has done , because just as a team could the do that what they managed to have .
so , ai at school , that these three things people could , that if only , ai at school , in the we for 's lives learning .
but there are still <unk> fourth thing and the is me almost even more .
and that learning is itself .
if the only thing , what we about the future safe to tell you can is that they uncertainty is then is the ability , and again , new to learn and fun and to have this learning to see the <unk> that , that we 're in <unk> life , and that our children in <unk> lives are successful .
that if only ' yet , ai at school , that these things that .
but where i was ?
i sat in this <unk> and the of them , the children have , the know that 's not just just an event is , for that you <unk> pay to .
so just an event after the slogan , everything i said , but not yet from each .
up until the moment , where <unk> 're elected , there are then suddenly all of invisible .
yes , i was sitting there and what do i say , the <unk> one of my kids were these <unk> still the funniest parts of the event .
less fun it was for me as a father , if you so the stress about to the issue homework and learn the entire family life <unk> .
and much less fun makes it , if the child sick is , because in school stress this is now .
and finally ended up these <unk> or was a peak of these <unk> at this school , again , so 'n <unk> .
just taken it was also not a <unk> , it was rather like a <unk> , so , right after the last hour and in fact , we were also the single parents , the invited to have been .
and i <unk> ' you now , and me the detail by after the moment was clear , we need to our child there <unk> , that wo n't all .
<unk> are but two years , in which we did have , there 's something not .
what do we really wrong ?
and we had to actually the question which is our child fail ?
and we are the only , where it this is ?
now did i in the last two years ago , since i 'm in the theme 'm involved with very many people talking and got ' found , no way i did , learned , you 're not alone .
out there are very many , where it very similar to go and that was in two years ago , because i sat with <unk> <unk> together we were just about , a new business to form , have day we thought , where the journey there goes , and night we sat on the cash and have us about private things shared .
and what do i say , he was me almost the same story about with one of his children he 's almost the same experienced as we , and we had the good that we our children there <unk> could from school , yeah ?
in berlin it 's one ai <unk> at different schools and we could even private in to consider .
but it can anyone out there are doing ?
somehow was us that to little bit , just our children in safety to bring and this day out there be like this to let you , are .
and after we both now the sense had , school has to since we there were n't really changed we thought , yeah well , we are the first , the issue now let 's way .
is , what we going as <unk> there anything change ?
good that is that we 's fooled have .
we 're not alone .
but we did relatively quickly ai whole range of amazing people found , the what you wanted as we , which is just school create , that everybody in them something that will .
it 's not so that just the children and their parents under the suffering , which out there often happens .
if we have the teacher at , 30 percent of teachers have <unk> .
if we look at , how the number of <unk> in the last 10 years has changed the has to doubled .
it can now be , that all parents what going wrong ?
that all children broken , and that even those teachers broken are ?
or it can be , we a school system have , that just n't like that fit , like this <unk> ago <unk> years ago , of fit just do n't like that right .
and we have many people found , where it similarly , and we even people found , that do n't have kids .
and they 've understood that you take responsibility to for the future that they take responsibility to for the future , by you take responsibility for that what we our children and the kids that the now in the school go with , on the way to be .
and we have us to <unk> second point <unk> it 's out there ai whole range of great initiatives , change the school want , and there is it 's <unk> schools , here and there really neat <unk> and there 's almost on every school teacher , that actually committed and are a difference want .
and you even the one or other brave principal , the and then also <unk> the first step to go .
and how we should now as <unk> help ?
we had itâ€™s no concept , we there now about helping could .
but we can one thing do , we can in those schools go and we can in these schools that people , the school is like , so the parents , the teachers and the students , bring together and we can with are in two days just lot of this move .
there are so people together , the in the past more like this other have worked and the learning in two days , what does each other to work .
that come with <unk> very particular challenge that you in common problems .
and after two so days have the then for example , a new <unk> evolve or the broken given for just completely new high as we 're at a berlin school right part of get to .
or the have concrete actions for on bullying problems that you in your school have , evolved .
within two days in developed approaches , the next day immediately be realized can .
but what that <unk> is what about these two days happens , and that makes it for me and so beautiful the small weekends , that i did ' , then also times in schools in very germany to spend , is that energy , that there 's when the three things learn .
if the three things together experience , which is so what about how flexibility <unk> .
so sort of <unk> think and if you to as a team experience .
then that is such a spark , the <unk> .
and if we four weeks after that <unk> workshop to this ai at school come back then learn is we have the school as a whole started has , to change , that there ai totally new culture formed .
and this is incredible fuckinâ€™ wicked .
and i <unk> ' she even invited to about school to think .
i <unk> ' she 's an about , school thinking .
and i <unk> ' they of all also invited , it , about school , to talk .
talk you about that what you do but talk , they that at what you do n't like .
they will be surprised how much , <unk> you get and how many people that same have seen , but just not talking about it .
let us let us every single school in germany to the <unk> century them .
let us the entire system change .
and let us that collectively do with people to school day for day off , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because all together , we do this .
thank you .
