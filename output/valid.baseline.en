you know , a great <unk> the travel and one of have been ourselves in the <unk> research is , together with the people to live , and even at the old days can remember . the your past still in wind will feel , you on the rain <unk> rocks touch , you in the bitter leaves the plants delicious .
just that know that <unk> , and beyond the milky travel , or the importance of myth of the oldest of the inuit more full of meaning is , or that the himalayas the buddhists , and the breath of <unk> tracking , which means , and the central epiphany of anthropology into memory to shout out , that 's the idea , the world in the we live , not in one absolute sense exists , but just as a model of reality , as a result of a group of certain ways of things that we know , <unk> successful , in many generations chose .
and of course , what we all the same <unk> .
we 're all born . we get kids to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we need to us with the <unk> separating by the death who and so it to us not surprise , we all singing , dancing and art and dignity .
but interesting is the unique cadence of <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it does it does n't matter , whether it is to the <unk> in the forest of borneo is , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior , in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> in the middle of the sahara . this is by the colleague , with the i a month ago in the desert traveled am . or even a <unk> at the hanging of <unk> , everest , the <unk> the world .
all these people teach us that it 's another <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways to orient on earth there .
and that 's an idea , the , if you think about , one with just hope they can .
together and the infinite cultures the world a net of <unk> and cultural life that 's the earth wrapped up in and for this probably the earth as important is how the biological <unk> , that you as a biosphere it .
you can , this cultural <unk> as a <unk> imagine . <unk> can do that when the <unk> of thoughts and dreams , myths ideas , inspirations and <unk> , the of human imagination since we of consciousness generated were , be defined .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it 's the symbol of all of what we 're and why we a wondrous <unk> species are capable .
and just like the biosphere for wear away was , was done this with the <unk> -- just with even more speed .
not a biologist would for example , dare to argue that 50 percent or more of all kinds about to the extinctions is , because it just not true . and yet , this -- that <unk> <unk> on the area of biological diversity -- is hardly anything with what us as <unk> <unk> in the area of the cultural diversity known .
and the key an indicator of this is the extinction of languages .
as any of them in this room was born , were on earth got 6,000 views languages spoken .
now is a language not just the totality of <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of human spirit .
it 's a means with of the soul a given culture access to the material world finds .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , an inflection point , a thought , an ecosystem spiritual possibilities .
and of this got 6,000 views languages are today , we here in monterey sit , exactly half the not more in the ears of kids <unk> .
they 're <unk> not more taught . this is , if nothing done is , you 're actually been dead .
what could be lonely be , as the silence wrapped up in to be , one of the past your people to be , the your language talk , no way to have , the wisdom of the ancestors passing , or the hope to kids should occur ?
and yet , get this horrible what happens to actually somebody somewhere on earth , about . of two weeks , because of two weeks , dies a an old man and take the last <unk> an old language with it into the grave .
and i know that some of you say , `` it 's not better way ? '' would be the world not a better place , if we all just a language talk to be ? '' and i say , '' well , let 's this language yoruba be . let them <unk> be .
let them kogi be . ''
and then they would suddenly realize there , it would be , if you their own language not could talk .
so i want you today in on a journey through the <unk> take away , a short journey through the <unk> , to try , you get across to do what actually been lost is .
now is some of us , the sort forget , i , when i say `` different possibilities of being , '' really different possibilities of being mean .
and take for example this child of <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the people the anaconda , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from east around the belly of a snakes <unk> .
this is a people , which not being cognitively between the colored blue and green is , because that <unk> the forest , of the the people depend on , <unk> is .
they have a curious phenomena language and a <unk> the linguistic <unk> is called , you have someone get married , that one another language talks .
so all of rooted in the mythological past . this curious phenomena in this big houses , in which because of <unk> six or seven languages spoken to be , is , is , you never who hear , that one learns language .
they 'll just to and start then to talk .
or , one of <unk> tribes , with whom i ever have lived , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first started the year , 1958 peaceful who was .
the year 1957 tried to five missionaries came in record and did a some mistakes .
they threw <unk> photos of , from the air down , what we as kind 's what would . and <unk> you , these people from the rainforest in their lives have never something <unk> had seen .
they <unk> these photographs from the forest floor up , trying behind the face or the character to see , found nothing and <unk> , that this business cards of the devil 's and killed the five missionaries came with the spear .
but the <unk> killed more than <unk> with the spear .
they <unk> to each other .
54 percent of deaths were by <unk> .
we followed the <unk> eight generations go back and found two cases of a natural death and when we the people with more something about <unk> , you gave to , one of people that age has been him , because of middle-aged died , and we killed him still with the spear .
but at once they had a clear amount of forests , the amazing was .
their be able to the urine of animal 's from 40 go away smell and determine , to which species of mine .
in the early <unk> years ago i got a really amazing job , as me my professor in harvard said , if i can be interested in , to haiti to go and the secret societies to infiltrate , the the foundation of the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> was and the venom , that it was used in , <unk> to do , make sure .
and this <unk> a sense to give i had to of course , something about this remarkable think of <unk> knowledge and voodoo is not a cult of black magic .
in the opposite , , it 's about a complex <unk> way .
it 's interesting .
if i you to ask , the great world faiths <unk> , what they would say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> or what also the .
a continent will always <unk> , because the true was that it in sub-saharan africa not religious faith give . of course there was a and voodoo 's just the remnant of these very <unk> religious thought , that during the tragic diaspora the <unk> <unk> .
but what voodoo so interesting does is this is relationship between the living and the dead .
the living or birthing the spirits .
the spirits , from below the large water <unk> 're going to answer to the rhythm of dance , in the soul of living cause to crowd , so that the <unk> for a short glittering coat at the god will .
<unk> say the <unk> like , `` your white is going into the church and you talk about god .
we dancing in the temples , and going to god . ''
and because you an are , you going to of the mind going . how can to harm caused be ?
you see these amazing demonstrations , <unk> in a <unk> , the red coal , burning <unk> , an amazing visualization of the ability of mind the body like to impact , that this it <unk> , when it in a state of extremes arousal put it .
now , of all people that i 've met , were the kogi from the sierra nevada de santa <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> .
been the old <unk> civilization , the the <unk> coastal plain from colombia world and in a result of conquest moved to that people in a <unk> <unk> can go back , that over the <unk> coastal plain up .
in a <unk> continent , were these people the only , the never by the <unk> conquered were .
until the modern day , they by a ritual priesthood govern . the training to priesthood is , is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> be in the age three and four years of their families detached and in a <unk> world of dark , in <unk> at <unk> the glacier for 18 years <unk> . two periods of each nine years ago , 're elected , in the nine months of pregnancy imitate , that you in your lap they ca mother used , you spending so <unk> in your lap the great mother .
and during this whole time , they are culturally in the value of their society introduced . values , the the claim web , that your prayers and just your prayers , the cosmic company -- or we can say that green -- balance web .
the end of this amazing <unk> you will be one day , suddenly out to , and the first time in your life , at the age of 18 years ago , you see a sunrise . and in this <unk> moment of consciousness of the first light , when the sun is starting on the <unk> the remarkably good landscape to rays , is suddenly everything , which it in abstract 've learned in an amazing glory confirmed . and the priest 're going back and says , `` you see ? it 's really how i 'm telling have .
it 's so wonderful . you have it protect . ''
they say , the older brother and say that we the we the younger brother is , for the destruction of the world together .
now this level of intuition is very important .
and if we 're on native and landscape think , conjure we 're either <unk> and the old rumor of fancy side wild up , which in his simplification a <unk> idea is or other hand <unk> and say , these people are more with nature connected , when we .

there is not much space that in the <unk> swamps of <unk> or the cold <unk> from tibet , they have but nevertheless , through time , ritual a mysterious gaping <unk> of the world shaped , of not on the idea is based , you know close to be , but on a far <unk> intuition , the idea that the earth at the only exist can , because they 're in the human consciousness <unk> will .
now , which means that ?
it means that a little kid from the andes , that in the think up , that the mountain a <unk> is , of his or what they figure out , is a very another person will , and a different relationship to this resource , or this place have , as a little kid from montana , that in the think up , that a mountain making a stone is , the wear away can be .
if he a abode of mind or a bunch <unk> is , is irrelevant .
the interesting is the metaphor , which the relationship between the individual and the nature defined .
i grew up in the woods by british colombia , and believed that these forests and there are , <unk> to be .
it made me to a different people as my friends , the <unk> , who believe that these forests of the abode of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> spirits are , in the <unk> the world of housing , spirits , that you at their <unk> engage would .
now , if you start , the idea of looking at , these cultures of reality which can , you some of their extraordinary discoveries understand . for example . this plant here .
it 's a picture , that i just last april in the northwest of the amazon had .
this is an ayahuasca , of the many of you 've heard , the most powerful <unk> <unk> from the repertoire of <unk> .
what an ayahuasca so fascinating does is not just that <unk> potential that <unk> , but of processing . it will actually from two different sources made . on the one hand , there are these wooden disk <unk> , the a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , slightly <unk> , hold . these <unk> just taking is something like this as if you a blue <unk> smoke in their minds put , it 's but with the leaves of a <unk> from the family of <unk> with the name <unk> <unk> up .
this plant contains some very strong <unk> the of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very much are .
if you 've been at the <unk> 've seen , as you this stuff <unk> , this substance , from the different ways to there are also <unk> .
this <unk> to <unk> is something like this like a <unk> <unk> to be , <unk> of <unk> paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it 's no distortion of reality is , but the resolution of reality .
i even with my professor , richard <unk> <unk> , the man , of the psychedelic <unk> with the discovery of the magic fungi in mexico in the <unk> years , which gave it , about it . i said , you this <unk> not as <unk> categorize could , there in the moment in that you the effects senses , you do n't there is , in a <unk> to know .
but the thing to <unk> is the , they do n't <unk> it can be , because you through a in the human gut , <unk> enzyme with names <unk> , <unk> to .
they can only in connection with some different chemicals <unk> going to be , the the mao <unk> .
now that 's fascinating , the <unk> , the in the <unk> in them are , <unk> of the same kind of these are , that is necessary , in the <unk> to <unk> . and ask so even .
how can these people from an ancient by 80,000 kinds <unk> plant these two morphologically not related plants find , that if , on this way combined , a kind of <unk> version create , so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts is ?
we use these great euphemism , try and error , which is as meaningless -- it turns out .
but ask you the native you say , `` the plant talks to us . ''
so , which means that ?
this tribe , the <unk> , got 17 varieties of an ayahuasca , that they all at great distance in the forest see , the for our eyes as a way out .
and then ask you you how they their <unk> <unk> and they say , `` i thought you <unk> something of plants .
i mean , you know nothing at ? '' and i said , `` no . ''
so , it turns out , you any of 17 varieties , at full <unk> and they sing to a in a different <unk> .
now , that gives you a ph.d. in harvard , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> to count .
so , that <unk> the problem is that even those of us , and sympathy for the difficult to the native have , you as <unk> and <unk> look , they but somehow on the past just , as the world , which our world , <unk> .
so , in fact , that you , at the 20 . century , in 300 years not for his war or technological innovation will remember , but rather than at an era , in the we <unk> was and the massive destruction of biological and cultural variation on earth either take action support his or passive accepted . so this problem is not the change .
all cultures have again , at the dance with new <unk> participating .
and the problem is not the technology to yourself .
the <unk> were not less on the sioux to be , when they came and arrow tasks , as the americans stopping americans to be , when you horse and <unk> tasks .
do n't change and technology on the integrity of <unk> . it 's power . this ugly face of the rule .

or if we 're in the mountains of tibet go , where i <unk> much work on , you going that ugly face of political dominance see .
you know , the genocide , that <unk> extinction by people will not secret for , but the <unk> , the destruction of the way of people , will not just not a , but generally and <unk> as part of a <unk> celebrated .
and they do that suffering <unk> n't understand , if you do n't on <unk> level had .

the father this young <unk> was a believer of <unk> lama identified .
that meant that he during the chinese invasion immediately get killed got .
his uncle <unk> with their sanctity in the diaspora , the people to nepal got .
his mother was locked up , as punishment to -- for the crime wealthy to be .
he was in the age two years in the prison smuggled in , and under your <unk> to hide , because it without it does n't life could .
the nurse , that these <unk> did <unk> , was in a <unk> started doing .
one day , it out on on a so <unk> and for these <unk> had to them for seven years in a heavy labor .
this is that <unk> can unbearably be , but the <unk> spirit of people 's something <unk> .
and the end we 're really , a choice . we would in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity life ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist said before she died , it their greatest fear is that as we ourselves into the one thread , <unk> , <unk> way around , we 're not just the whole range of human imagination to a <unk> you think they would see , but that we one day from a dream wake up , and have forgotten , it ever other possibilities there .
and it 's <unk> to think about , that our species maybe for over 600,000 years exists .
the <unk> revolution us , the agricultural got , and us that moment , the cult of <unk> <unk> , the poetry of <unk> through the prose the priesthood big and hierarchy , specialization and have created -- found , just 10,000 years happening .
the modern industrial world as we know it 's hardly see 300 years old .
now this <unk> history tells me not that we all the answers on the challenges have , which we in the next millennia to stand .
when those infinite <unk> after the importance of about being human , `` would you with 10,000 various voices .
and in this song we 'll be the opportunity to rediscover this , to be what we are : people with under way of consciousness , and the importance of that are all people and we a room are to can <unk> to be . and there are great moments of the optimism .
here 's a picture , that i at the northern end of <unk> who , when i with <unk> on the <unk> left . and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his favorite number .
the canadian government is not always very well with the inuit going and during the <unk> years in part of <unk> our regime , they were forced in , settlements to move .
the grandfather this old man 's refused to .
the family , the fear for his life had , took him all of guns and all the tools out .
now have to you know that the inuit not afraid of the cold have . they used them to their advantage .
the <unk> their <unk> , originally from fish , in the <unk> <unk> was , made .
the grandfather of man was not to before the arctic night , or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> out to , let his pants up for <unk> down and <unk> in his hand . and when the hits to <unk> started , shaped he them in the shape of <unk> .
he <unk> saliva on the sides of <unk> and when it completely frozen was , <unk> he a dog that .
he <unk> the dog and improvisational a <unk> , took this skeleton of the dog and improvisational a <unk> , started putting a one other dog and <unk> about the towering ice sheets with the <unk> at belt .
so you can from n't do something .
and this is in many ways a symbol for the opposition of the inuit and all indigenous to the world .
the canadian government had the inuit in april 1999 the complete control over a field back , that 's bigger than california , texas , together .
it 's our new home country and is <unk> .
it 's an independent area . they control all <unk> .
an amazing example , as a nation , a state , and atonement with its people look and achieve can .
and ultimately , i believe , it 's pretty obvious , at least for those of us , the to these distant for the earth 've gone are , to realize that they do n't actually off .
they are the <unk> of someone .
they represent parts of human imagination , the in times past go back . and for all of us , are the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children of the geography of hope .
what we at national geographic and try , is that we believe that politicians ever do something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> no conclusive is , but we believe that storytelling the world can change and so we 're probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website , 35 million ones every month .
156 nations to send our tv channel .
our magazines be of millions read .
and we do a series of travel in the <unk> , in which we our audience to places of this cultural wonder take away , they of that you too are blinded . and hopefully , you will be one after another the central epiphany of anthropology on , that this world it makes it , in various ways to exist , we a <unk> in a really multicultural <unk> world can find , the the wisdom of all people to our shared it can contribute .
thank you .
what i you first , so fast as possible , you 'll , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we microsoft as part of a <unk> ago exactly one year , to have . that 's <unk> . and it 's an environment in the you either local or away with huge amount of visual data can deal .
we see many , many <unk> to digital photographs here , you seamlessly , and ongoing <unk> , pan , in any way , arranged can .
and it 's no matter how many of information we look , how big that collections is or how big the images are .
the most of you 're digital shot photographs of a camera , but this one is for example , a scan of the lessons and it 's in a domain of 300 <unk> .
it does n't matter , because the only thing , what the output a system like this be constrained can , is the number of <unk> on your screen in every moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example for <unk> .
this is <unk> house of dickens . a quote is a chapter .
in order to prove that it 's really about a text and not a picture is , we can be something like so , to really to show that this an actual representation of <unk> and not a picture is .
maybe this is an artificial way , a <unk> to read .
i would n't recommend .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that there are you really the pleasure and the good experience a real <unk> a magazine , or a newspaper to read what to be a kind of medium with several scales is .
we also something on the corner of these special edition of the guardian did .
we have a false ad with very high which designed , the much higher than at a normal ad is and we 've added the added .
if you the functions car that like to see , you can you see here .
or different models , or even technical <unk> .
and this 're really those ideas on , these constraints for the available place in the screen less than .
we hope that 's no <unk> and other nonsense longer means -- that should n't be necessary .
obviously this is mapping then one of really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i 'm here really do n't really spend time , except to say that we also to this area contribute to .
but these are all roads in the <unk> .
<unk> up on the <unk> picture of nasa .
let us now something else out .
this is actually now live in the internet . you can it <unk> .
this is a project with the name <unk> , that actually two different technologies together together .
the one is <unk> and the other is a very good science about <unk> , the of noah <unk> , a <unk> the university washington , under the advice from steve <unk> at the <unk>
and rick <unk> of microsoft research doing was . a very good working together .
so this is live in the internet . it will of <unk> powered .
you can see that , if we this kind of views create , in which we by images through can and this experience of <unk> which do .
but the spatial configuration of imagery is here in fact of meaning .
the <unk> have these pictures together we so you the real space , where these images , all in the near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> were made , are . you see here elements of stabilized , slides here or <unk> <unk> and these things were all in perspective in relationship with set .
i know exactly , if i still time , you different environments to show .
it 's what , the much <unk> are .
i 'd like straight one of <unk> <unk> of noah show and this is from an early prototype of <unk> in which we first started in summer , have worked in , you that to show , i think that it really the punch line of this technology , the <unk> is . and this is not necessarily so clearly , if you the environment at , that we on the site have .
we had to us because of the lawyers and so forth . worry .
this is a <unk> the cathedral notre dame lady , that exclusively in the computer with images from flickr after every . give you just notre dame lady in flickr a and they are pictures of men in t-shirts and on the <unk> etc . here . each of these <unk> <unk> represents a picture that as to this model <unk> was discovered .
so these are all <unk> , and they all stand in perspective on this way in relationship with each other .
and we 're able to this very simple way navigate .
. you know , i never thought , i finally at microsoft 're going to .
i 'm very grateful for the reception in here .
. i suppose they can see that this many different kinds of these are : it 's about , of the <unk> to professional <unk> , a pretty large number of them , all in this environment <unk> were .
and as possible , i 'm going some of obscure find .
many of you 're of their faces covered by etc .
somewhere here 's a series of photographs -- there are you .
this is actually a poster of notre dame lady , the right recorded was .
we can of the poster to a physical view this environment switch .
the point is here , we things with the social environment then it can . there are now data from all gathered -- of the whole collective storage of them , like , with the planet looks -- and everything is linked together .
all these photographs are linked together and it 's something that 's bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that from around the earth going on .
look at them that as the sequel of labor of stephen <unk> of virtual earth .
and this is something that through the complexity , with the the people use it , growing and its use to the user to the deployment and bigger .
their own photos are going to metadata <unk> , the one another person into it .
if to someone bother has done and all this holy <unk> , and it , who you 're all , it 's my photo of the notre dame <unk> suddenly to all these data held and i can you when you start using in , in this space to dive , in this <unk> , the pictures of other people are using and so a kind of <unk> <unk> of social experience with the use of other seller do .
and of course , design all of that are immense rich virtual models of any interesting part of the earth , the not only by <unk> or satellite images and so on get there were , but through collective memory .
thank you .
. do i you right ? their software to , that to at a certain , within the next few years , all of pictures that of someone in the world together to be used in principle , linked together to be ?
yes . she does not different than find .
if you want made it <unk> between the images .
and they 're doing this because of content in the images .
and this is really exciting , if you to the amount of semantic information think , the many of these images have .
as if you a <unk> for images make , where they sentences . and the text the site of a lot of information about , which picture that 's .
but how about it when the image you with all their pictures connecting ?
then is the scope of semantic <unk> and the wealth , and it makes , really enormous . it 's a classic <unk> .
<unk> , this is amazing . thank congratulations .
you have thank you .
i 'll tell you some things from my book about the way that i hope that in order in other things that are you 've already heard . and i 'll try to myself a couple of connections to create , if you this n't notice are .
i want to start with , what i `` official dogma '' call .
the official dogma of what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized world societies .
the official dogma works like this : if our target that maximize the <unk> of citizen , is about this of all through the <unk> of freedom of individuals .
the reason for this is that freedom in yourself is good , valuable , make sense , a <unk> principal requirement for human .
when people freedom have , it 's one of us for themselves to the things to do , that our common good maximize and they have to us to decide .
the way freedom to maximize is choice to maximize .
the more choices people have , the more freedom , you have . and the more freedom , you 've , the more common good did you .
this is , i think , so deep in our water a basis , that it 's not in the sense get it would to question .
and it 's also deeply in our lives rooted .
i 'll tell you some examples of that giving , what us modern forward to .
this is my supermarket . a big .
i 'd just briefly about a <unk> say .
it 's probably 175 <unk> in my supermarkets , if you the 10 different extra <unk> not more and 12 <unk> that they buy us to a large number of your lettuce <unk> make , in the improbable case , that none of 175 in the shop for you right is .
so this is , like the store is .
and then they 're going to the <unk> business for a <unk> put together -- speakers , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , <unk> . and in this an electronics store it 's so many <unk> equipment .
we can <unk> millions of <unk> facilities put out the components , the in this a business are offered .
you must admit that 's a large selection is .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
it was a time when i was a boy , because you could every phone 's have the you wanted , unless it from and bell was .
they have your phone <unk> . you have n't it <unk>
a consequence of who was that the phone ever broken was .
these days are over .
we 've now almost an infinite variety of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile the future .
my favorite is the in the center -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> torch .
and i want you that until n't go in your business 've seen , you can be safe , it 's going to be .
and what it does is it brings people do in the business to walk and this question to imagine .
you know now what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is `` no . ''
it 's not possible a cell phone to buy this , not too much does .
in other aspects of life , the very much with an than that buy of objects are , you see the explosion of choices to .
health -- it is no longer the case in the united states that you to medical attention to go and the doctor says you do what is .
instead , go to the doctor and the doctor says them , we could i do or we could b do .
a has a these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what you want to do ?
and they say , `` doctor , what do i do ? ''
the doctor says , a has a these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what you want to do ?
and if you say , `` if you i 'd be , doc , what would you do ? ''
the doctor says , `` but i 'm not you . ''
the result is we call it `` patient autonomy . it sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shifting of burden of responsibility for the meeting of decisions of someone of something know -- namely the doctor -- to explore the n't know , and more is sick and it 's why not in the best doing well is a decision to meet -- namely the patient .
it 's a tremendous marketing for made drugs for people like you and i , that , if you think about , ever had no sense power , because we do n't buy .
why make them to us , if we do n't can buy ?

something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide show is to .
we an n't have identity , we invent it .
and we reinvent ourselves that often , how we want .
this is , that every day , if you the morning wake up , you to make , what a kind of person they want .
in relation to marriage and family , there was a time , in the the <unk> was that almost every one had and that you so fast were married soon as you could , and then as fast as kids got how they could .
the only true election was `` who , '' not any time , and not what they seem that did .
nowadays everything is just to have .
i teach wonderful , intelligent students , and i 'll give you 20 percent less work as i used to be doing .
and not because they 're less smart are , and not because they 're less carefully are .
it 's because they 're in other things too are , they they ask yourself , `` do i get married , or not ? do i now marry ?
do i later , marry ? do i just have kids , or just have done ? ''
that 's all <unk> questions .
and they 're going to answer those questions regardless of , if this is all the tasks to make that i you <unk> and a bad grade in my headed to get .
and in fact , you to do that . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we 're blessed , as carl illustrates is , with the technology is that allows us every minute of every day of every place on planet to work -- up on the <unk> hotel .
it 's actually a corner , of the i do n't tell me , at the that <unk> works .
i 'm going to it n't tell you , because i use it wants .
so what does , this incredible freedom of choice we have in relation to work decisions to hit again , and again , and again , whether we to work or not to work .
we can our children in the football game move beyond , and we have our mobile phone at the a hip , and our blackberry , at other hip , and our laptop is probably in your lap .
and even if you all off are , every minute , in the we our child in <unk> of a <unk> <unk> we ask ourselves as well , `` i should this call would ?
i should on this email answers ? should i this letter writing ? ''
and even when the answer to the question `` no , '' is it 's certainly your experience of <unk> of your child <unk> very different than it would have been .
everywhere where we look carefully , great things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in the we lived looked like this .
so i want to say , there was a few options , but not it was a question of choice .
and the world in the now we live looks like this .
and the question , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is `` yes .
we all know what good thing is , so i 'll about what bad thing is .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
an effect , <unk> way , is that he 's hamstringing instead of free .
with so many options out the you choose can , it will people very hard to the first place to pick .
i 'm going to them another one <unk> example of giving , a study about investing in them <unk> .
a colleague of me had access to <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> from about a million employees and about . 2000 different jobs .
and what they found was a 10 <unk> the of employers offered , took the participation in two percent off .
they 're 50 <unk> to -- 10 percent less and taking part of as if you just five to dignity . why ?
because it 50 <unk> are , the to the choice away , it 's so hard to decide what you choose to , they it on tomorrow keep procrastinating .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow 's obviously never .
you know , that the not only is , that people <unk> need to eat when they 're in the retirement go , because not enough money to travel have , it also means , that make decisions so hard is that they big <unk> your employers to miss .
by the n't participate in they give up to 5,000 u.s. dollars per year on of the <unk> , the happy would have been their contributions to reproduce .
paralysis is a consequence of to many options .
and i think there it makes , the world looks like this .
they want to the decision really properly meeting , if it for all eternity is , right .
they do n't want the wrong investment fund vote , or even the fake <unk> .
so this is the an effect . of different effect is that even if we that paralysis get over and make a decision , how far we 're less happy with the result of selection , as , if we the opportunity had had to us between less ways to decide .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is growing up through the large selection of <unk> , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect -- and , which <unk> 's been perfect ? it 's easy to imagine that you a different decision have can make the better would have been . and what happens is this about <unk> alternative is that , that they the decision regrets , and this regret the negative on the average happiness , that you by her in decision had , as well , if it 's a good decision was .
the more opportunities and there , the more easy it 's nothing at to regret that 's disappointing for the choice that they meet .
secondly , what economists <unk> call .
dan gilbert 's a big point now this morning made by he told as much the way in the we evaluate things , on it to what 's what we compare .
well , if it 's a lot of alternatives to think there , it 's easy to an attractive properties to imagine of alternatives , that they exclude , that makes them less happy with the alternatives , that they voted have .
here 's an example . for the of them , the no new yorker is , sorry i me .
but here 's what they would have thought should .
here 's a few on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it all for themselves .
what could be better ? `` damn '' the man who thinks , `` it 's august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could directly in my house park . ''
and he spend two weeks of the idea of that he the opportunity to miss it , day about day , a great parking lot to have .
<unk> reduce the average happiness , that we by our choice get , as well , if it 's what we chose have amazing is .
and the more ways it to selection is , the more attractive properties of selection are in the <unk> into account .
here 's another example .
now , this cartoon is doing some statements .
he 's a statement about the now to live and may also about things start to .
but an important point , the he does is , and who , you for one thing to decide , you decide to other things not to do .
and these other things like a lot of an attractive properties have , and it will , what do they 're less appealing do .
three , <unk> the expectations .
this , i met , when i mean for exchange wanted .
i 'm jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in the it just for a kind of there , and they have you bought , and they have a <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and if you you long enough by and often enough bathed in had , you have begun , `` okay '' <unk> .
so was about new jeans to buy after many years of <unk> the old , and i said , `` i 'd like a few jeans , here 's my size . ''
and the sales person said , `` you want to <unk> , slightly <unk> or large ?
you want to buttons or <unk> ? rock or acid bathed in ?
you want to jeans with holes ?
you want down a papercutting , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ... '' and so on he told .
my jaw was down and after i 'm an i said , `` i 'd like to the way , that used to the only way was . ''
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour with all this bloody jeans <unk> , and <unk> the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best <unk> jeans , i ever had .
i did it better . all that choice made it me it better to have .
but i felt me down .
why ? i wrote a whole book in order to try it to myself to explain .
the reason for , i 'm worse felt was , with all those we have opportunities , my expectations of what for good a few jeans is like , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no particular expectations , when it you just in kind there .
when you in a hundred species came , damn , one of you would be perfect should ,
and what i got was okay , but it was n't perfect .
and so by i what i have had to the what i expected , and what i had been disappointing in comparison to the what i expected .
this add of opportunities in the life of people increases inevitably the expectations that people have about how well these are going to be .
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results , even if the results are good .
nobody in the world of <unk> know that . because , if it would , knew them all not what it 's about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that 's used everything was better than anything worse was as anything worse was , it was to people can experience to make the a pleasurable surprise was .
now , in the world in the we live -- we 're wealthy , industrialized world citizens , to perfection as an expectation -- the best for that you ever hope it 's the things are so good as you it of you expected .
you 'll never comfortable surprised . because your expectations , my expectations , <unk> are .
the secret to <unk> -- that 's what they all came here are -- the secret to <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i with women married am , and it 's actually very beautiful .
i 'd better than this can do . i did not <unk> .
but preferred to settle is n't so a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of <unk> a bad <unk> jeans if it 's only one way to buy there is that if you way are , and 're wondering why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you can do ?
if hundreds of different types of jeans are available , and they buy a the disappointing is , and you ask why , who is in charge ?
it 's also realized that the answer to the question is you .
you 'd better than this can do .
with 100 different kinds of for the windows , there 's no excuse for error .
and so , when people make decisions , and even when the results of choices are good , feel it and disappointed about , they <unk> to itself .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the past generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the disappointing are because their standards so high are . and then , if you to these experiences himself explain to , you think it would be your fault .
and so that 's <unk> , it 's generally better go , objective , and we 's bad feeling .
so let me if you .
this is the official dogma , this one that we all for really think , completely wrong . it 's not true .
it 's no question , that some selection is better than no , but it follows not , that more selection is better than a choice .
it 's a magical lot . i do n't know what it 's .
i 'm pretty sure that we this point a missed have to the choice our common good better .
now , as a charter question -- i 'm almost finished -- as an axiom question , the thing about the thinking is that . what all these selection are in the industrialized world societies , is the material wealth .
you have many places in the world , and we have of many of you heard , the problem not the to large selection is .
your problem is that you to n't have .
so the things about that i 'm talking about are an odd problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what 's so frustrating and getting annoying is : steve levitt , you yesterday about it tells how these more expensive and hard to <unk> <unk> n't help . it 's a waste of money .
what i you 'll tell is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it 's not easy , that they do n't help .
they are actually hurt .
they make it that we got worse standing there .
if something from what the people our society are so decisions to meet to the societies in which people to some selection 've shifted would , would not only the human lives better , but our would also be improved upon .
economists call this one <unk> application .
<unk> going to worry , that everybody better go -- not just the poor -- because all these large selection are plagued by .
finally , reading do you this cartoon , and , an advanced person , says , `` ah ! what do this fish ?
you know it not possible in this <unk> . ''
<unk> imagination , a shortsighted , the world -- and that 's the way it as you read have .
the more but i thought about , the more i came to the view , that the fish you know .
because the truth is that if you that <unk> break , so that it 's possible , they have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you that <unk> break , so that it 's possible , lowering you the average happiness .
they increase that paralysis and reduce the average happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost a consummate security to limited -- possibly also for the fish , definitely for us .
but that <unk> be from a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for survivors , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i have about some of these projects are already been talking about , the genome and what it could mean , and over the discovery of groups of genes .
actually start we from a new point , we have the biology digitized , and now we try the digital code in a new phase of biology to get by we new life make and to .
we have been trying to great questions to imagine .
what 's life ? it 's something , i think that many biologists have tried to understand and this on different levels .
we have different approaches tried to it up on the minimal components to simplify .
we have nearly 20 years digitized . when we that <unk> have sequenced criminality was , the transition from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now we 're trying to ask if we live regenerate , or whether we new life make can , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , of the smallest genome of a species has the to itself in the lab replicate can . and we try if we it with a even smaller genome to do .
we have done on about a hundred genes to give up by the 500 or so here , are .
but if we have those metabolic map at , the very simple is , compared to our . trust me they , that 's pretty straightforward . but if we all those genes look at that we one after another eliminate can it 's very unlikely that this to a living cell 're going .
and so we decided to , it the only way ahead to is that chromosome in fact to <unk> what allows us the individuals components to <unk> and so some of fundamental question to imagine .
and so we began to with the question , we can be a chromosome <unk> ?
it 's allowed the chemistry this really big molecule to make what we 've never been made ?
and , if we can do that , we can that chromosome from now ?
a chromosome is so the only a piece <unk> chemical material .
our steps at the <unk> of life were growing exponentially .
our ability to genetic code to write it 's very slowly up but still turn up . and our last thing would go on an exponential curve sit down .
we have , 15 years with it started .
it was actually a few years starting with a <unk> review before we the first experiments did .
you do it turns out is <unk> very difficult .
it 's tens of thousands machines around the world that little pieces of dna can make , 30 to 50 letters , but it 's a <unk> process , so the longer you a piece of power , as more error happen .
so we had a new way come up with the we these little pieces together and the error correct could .
this is our first attempt , starting with the digital information , of the genome phi x 174 .
it 's a little virus of bacteria killing .
we created little pieces , made a <unk> and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the interesting thing we came when we this piece of <unk> we took and in a bacterium , , and this bacterium , the genetic code to read and went viral particles .
the viral particles , then from the cells creating and came back and killed e. coli .
recently i did with the <unk> spoken and they said that they this model just <unk> .
they were laughing at more than their it is what does .
so we think , that the a situation is in the software in fact that your hardware can build in a biological system .
but we wanted to have a lot go further . we wanted a whole <unk> chromosome building . it 's more than <unk> letters genetic code . so we thought us , we build it in <unk> of the size of the virus what we the size of <unk> <unk> able to to understand what the individuals components of a living cell .
design is key , and if you with digital information in the computer from now want to this digital information really all accurate be .
when we the genome first started in 1995 have sequenced was the <unk> at a mistake per 10,000 base pairs .
we found in <unk> 30 mistakes . if we the original sequence it would have it would never been possible <unk> .
a part of design is it , and to make the 50 letters for are and the with other <unk> pieces overlap have in , smaller <unk> to build with these together .
we have a unique elements is built into .
you might have heard that we <unk> built into have .
you think about it , : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
<unk> of these letters -- those letters actually encode about 20 amino acids , and here 's a single destiny to each of these amino acids .
so we can the genetic code using about our words to write , sentences , thoughts .
initially we 've only signed .
some people who was disappointed that 's no poetry was .
we have the pieces constructed so that we 're just with becomes be able to . it are enzymes are the this repair and again key .
and we 've started pieces to make , starting with pieces the five to <unk> letters them , put this line to <unk> to do about that to self-assemble , up to <unk> .
in every step we have these pieces of the surplus produced by that we 're sequencing could , because we tried a very robust process to create what you in a minute 'll see .
we tried to the point of <unk> to get .
so , it looks like a <unk> .
if we to these really big pieces getting -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- and then they are these not just in e. coli grow . it to all possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so went we have other mechanisms to .
we knew from a mechanism of <unk> <unk> is called , the the biology used to dna to fix , that these pieces of key can .
here 's an example of them . there 's an organism called <unk> <unk> the three million wheel to radiation <unk> .
you see in the upper field , that his chromosome out just drops .
12 to 24 hours later , has , everything again , so together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can totally extraordinarily parched be , you can even in a vacuum life .
i 'm absolutely certain that live in space exist and you can move , in search for <unk> conditions .
indeed , the nasa has shown that it 's a lot of that there 's out .
here 's a <unk> of the molecule that we 've created by we these things have used -- actually we 've just <unk> used to the right design of pieces we have you <unk> . yeast into these then automatically together .
this is not <unk> it 's a regular micrograph of .
it 's a big molecule , we it even with the <unk> can see .
that 's take pictures over a duration of six seconds .
this is the <unk> that we just recently finished have asked .
that 's about <unk> letters to <unk> code . it 's the largest molecule , with <unk> structure that ever of people who was created .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we it with a <unk> of 10 and without distances print would it would <unk> 're inside itself , just about this genetic code <unk> .
now , like from now we a chromosome ? how we activate it ?
obviously is that it with a virus very simple is . it 's much more complicated with bacteria to deal .
it 's also easier if you it in <unk> how we are doing , you take just the <unk> out and there is another into it , and that 's exactly what they all this about clones have heard .
at <unk> is that chromosome into the cell has but just recently we 've shown that you have a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another . can and that activates can .
we <unk> that chromosome one <unk> . roughly said , are these two here from each other as humans , mice . we gave some <unk> and so we that chromosome choose to . we <unk> to it becomes to all the proteins to destroy . and it was very amazing when we it in a cell , -- and they 're going to our very <unk> graphics there is --
the new chromosome to the cell .
indeed we thought , that 's the end is , but we tried the process something going to bring .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here that a second chromosome taken , or a third of <unk> , every time thousands of characteristics in just a second to a species <unk> .
people so , and evolution imagine as a gene that to a moment changed will have a lot of the biology missed .
it are enzymes are the <unk> be called the fact , dna digest .
that chromosome so in the cell was has neither ; the chromosomes that we added 've already .
it was in the cell <unk> and realized that other chromosome when someone else 's material <unk> it and so we had the end just a cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> the blue because of the genes that we added had .
and after a very short time it had all the characteristics of species forever and converted completely in a new species based on the new software that we in the cell have given .
all the proteins gradually , the membranes gradually it -- when we the genetic code read , it 's exactly what we ends have .
it may like genomic <unk> sound , but we can , by we the <unk> move things , quite dramatic change .
now i throw away , this is not the <unk> 's -- this is based on 3.5 billion years evolution
and i 've argues that we might 're about a new form of the cambrian explosion to create in the this massive new <unk> based on this digital design might be .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty obvious in terms on what we need .
we 're in from four to nine billion people in the next 40 years <unk> .
and it in my relationship to imagine : i was the year <unk> born .
today are three people on planet for each of the year <unk> there 's ; within of 40 years it to four be .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for about 6.5 billion people .
it 's a challenge that for nine to offer .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion <unk> oil . that 's a hundred million <unk> the day .
if we of biological processes thinking or any process in order to replace , it 's a huge challenge .
then , of course , it 's all the co2 from this material that in the atmosphere lands .
we 've now , from our discoveries from around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe in that these the <unk> the future are .
the <unk> had a dozen components and a look the diversity of the it in .
we hit here in the first line at the limitations of biological reality , and those of our idea .
we have today technology because of these rapid <unk> , in order to do what we <unk> genetics call .
we have now the possibility of a big robots to build the millions of chromosomes the day to be .
if you imagine those 20 million various genes to make or this way to optimize to octane fuel make or drugs new vaccines , we can with a just small team more molecular biology change as the last 20 years science .
and it 's just <unk> selection . we 're able to <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> and so forth .
this is a shot of his <unk> at the we work , with the you to actually sit down and new species on the computer design <unk>
you know , we do n't necessarily as it will look like . we know exactly how their genetic code will look like .
we focus on us now , to switch fuels the fourth generation .
they have recently corn to ethanol seen what just a bad experiment is .
we have switch fuels the <unk> and third generation the relatively soon out to the much higher <unk> will have , like octane fuel or different types of <unk> .
but that we think , the only way to biology a big impact without further in the cost on food or the reduction of the availability will have is if we co2 as starting material can see , and therefore we 're working on cells that this going away ,
and we think that we the first with <unk> the fourth generation will be , and that in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 is a method --
but -- in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of ways .
this is an organism that we 1996 described have .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , at virtually <unk> <unk> .
it converts co2 in methane and below the use of hydrogen as energy source .
we study whether we <unk> co2 can use , which simply to <unk> be brought could , <unk> the co2 in fuel , in this process to be .
within a short time we think , we could be in the be able to one of basic questions of life to solve .
you know , we 've really -- <unk> outcomes like that instead of the u.s. petrochemical plant industry . right . and if not at ted could do , where else ? a <unk> of energy to be .
but as we work currently is , the same approaches to the development of vaccines to use .
they have it this year with the flu seen , we 're always a year in the back up and have a dollar a little bit , if it about the right <unk> about .
i think that it changed can be by you <unk> vaccines in <unk> created .
this is it , like the future possibly could look with changes , can now the <unk> also be with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and maybe <unk> .
we are light years of them away from people to improve . our goal is it just , we a chance have long enough to survive to that potentially to . thank you .
on the last ted conference i had an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised back to come in , you to explain how the machine works .
now it 's so far as . and for all those who was n't there were , the lhc is the hardest science experiment that the neighborhoods was -- 27 kilometers in diameter .
its task is it , the conditions to create , which fewer than a <unk> second , beginning of the universe existed -- and that up to 600 million times within a second .
it 's just only breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine below of geneva .
we 're taking pictures of these <unk> in detectors on .
at that i work . he calls to <unk> detector -- go feet in the width , 22 feet in diameter .
so a spectacular picture of <unk> in the construction so you the out those .
on september 10 last year went off the machine the first time in .
and this picture was of <unk> taken .
it caused huge <unk> in control room inside .
it 's a picture of the first <unk> which all the halfway around the lhc <unk> , then on with a part of the lhc <unk> , in a rain of particles in the detector <unk> to make .
in other words , when we this image on september 10 saw , , we knew that this machine works , what a big glories is .
i do n't see , this the largest <unk> created , or this , when someone the google site went and the front page that found .
it means that we a cultural influence to the scientific reaching .
about a week later there was a problem with the machine that with these <unk> here to do had -- this golden wires here
those wires lead <unk> <unk> if the machine on <unk> 's going .
now , the engineers of you will you look at and say , `` no that they do n't . this is that little wires . ''
you can afford it , because if you you very far <unk> , they 're going to call <unk> .
at minus <unk> degrees here , cooler than the space between the stars , can those wires the tension could .
in one of connections , between about <unk> magnets in the lhc , there was a <unk> .
so heat , the wires slightly and <unk> <unk> just suddenly 150 times more resistance .
this was the outcome .
now , all that 's another wonderful when you imagine , the magnets about 20 tons weigh and it to about . 30 inches enter .
we <unk> so about 50 of the magnets
and you had to remove , what we also did .
we <unk> they created again , <unk> you .
they are now all back on their way back .
against the march is the lhc , <unk> be .
we 're going to him turn , and expect first data in june , july , to do , and put our journey on , to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , on a kind hardly those accidents , again , the debate about the value of science and <unk> on such boundary . it 's easy , such thing reject .
i think the fact that it so hard is , the fact that we about our borders , grab , is the value of things like the lhc .

thank you .
i 'm writer .
to write books 's my profession , but it 's natural more than that .
it 's also my big , into love and fascination .
and i expect not that is that ever change is .
however 's recent something curious in my life and my career happen , that made me has , my reference to this work up to rethink .
this curious phenomena incident was that i recently wrote a book was -- a biography called <unk> , pray , <unk> -- , that , decided not unlike all my previous books from some reasons in the world that frame and a big <unk> , an <unk> was .
the result is that i , no matter where i come , treating 'll be as i the crashing <unk> .
seriously -- the crashing <unk> !
for example are you very concerned up to me and say , `` fear them not that you that success never went to be ?
they have no fear that , they all their lives <unk> and never again a book create , that anybody in the world does ? never again ? ''
okay , that 's really courage .
it would be however , worse , if i 'm not remember it would , i was about 20 years ago when i as a teenager the first time of them told , i writer wanted to be , with the same kind of <unk> response been faced am .
the people said , `` did you no fear , never succeeded to have ?
you do n't fear that you the humiliation of rejection kills one ?
you do n't fear that you this craft your life for <unk> and it never thing occurs and that you on a <unk> <unk> dreams are going to -- your mouth filled with the bitter who of failure ? ''
so roughly , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , <unk>
yes , i 'm afraid of all those things .
and that i had always .
and i have , even more things are scared , that nobody <unk> would .
how algae -- and other <unk> things .
but , when it comes write about think i 've been recently about it , and ask me , why ?
this is that could ?
it 's logical , that of someone you 're going to him , scared of that has , the work to do to the , he professions feel ?
and what 's what is with the creative enterprises off , that it 's uncertainty about the other <unk> do -- in kind of how it other professions n't do ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i 'm at any situation in his 40 years as a chemist , remember , in the he was asked , whether it scares have , chemist to be .
with your <unk> , john -- how are you that ?
it just not before , you know ?
but about fair to be -- the group of the chemist , over the centuries not the reputation of <unk> <unk> people here .
we who seem but this kind of call to have . but not just the writer , but the creative of genres , seem to this call to have , mentally freak you to be .
so everything you must do , is , and the bitter <unk> of really great minds alone in the 20 century . watch , the young and a lot of their own hand died .
and even the ones who do n't actually <unk> <unk> , tracks from their talent really neglected been to be .
norman <unk> said about to his death in his last interview , <unk> my books , i was a little further <unk>
an extraordinary point that , that you about their <unk> can do .
but we flashes n't even if , we who is something like you hear , because we this kind of statements for so long time know . somehow we have the notion that <unk> and collective accepted , that creativity and tired of course <unk> and that art -- the end -- and to <unk> goes .
the question , i today , everyone here you want is , is this idea for them totally fine ?
you feel and comfortable with ? because with just one inch by looking at -- i feel myself with this notion n't even to .
i think they really .
and i think they 're dangerous . and i 'm not watching you , the next century copied it .
i think it 's better if we our big creative socializing to live .
and i know definitely , it for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous would be , to start , this dark path of true of <unk> -- especially in the fact , where i 'm in my career at was .
that is -- look : i 'm very young . i 'm only about . 40 years old .
i have may yet another 40 <unk> in me .
and it 's extremely likely , that all what i from now to write will of the world as the work being is , the after the <unk> success of my last book came , right .
i say it straightforward , because we 're here right now all sort of friends -- it 's most likely , that my greatest success behind me it .
oh , jesus , which for a thought !
this is that sort of the idea , that someone get these can , in nine o'clock in the morning to start , <unk> to drink . and that i want to do n't .
i would prefer to continue this work done , i love .
so is the question : how ?
after some time of <unk> seems to me that i , to continue to write to do , a kind of <unk> psychological are building design must .
somehow i have from now to find a way , and write a safe distance to real between me and my very natural <unk> about how the response to the writing will be .
while i in the last year after study models for it looked for have , in order to do , i 've also in the past looking and i tried , other societies have to find , to see if you might better or <unk> ideas about it had when we , you of creativity can help , with the emotional risks to deal , with the creativity are connected .
those search led me into the ancient greece and the ancient rome .
i follow me , because the cycle , again , close .
but in ancient greece and rome , people have n't believe , that creativity of people coming , okay ?
they believed that creativity a kind <unk> <unk> was , the from a distant , unknown source of the people coming -- from <unk> , know why .
the greeks called the divine <unk> of creativity <unk> .
from where socrates is known that he 's believed , he had one <unk> , of him wisdom from further away telling .
the <unk> had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative spirit a <unk> .
this is great . the <unk> did n't really that a genius a very clever little individual was .
they believed that a genius this kind magical <unk> being was , of the thought was , it literally in the walls of a <unk> lives -- about such as <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artists to work of invisible <unk> and the result of labor is going .
that 's brilliant -- there is it , there 's the distance , of the i talked about -- the psychological are building , the head of the following your work protect .
and everybody knew that it this worked , right ?
the artist of <unk> was in certain things protected , like , for example , too much <unk> , right .
if your work brilliant was <unk> you do all look for you <unk> . everybody knew that you this <unk> genius 've had this , you helpful .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew , your genius was something <unk> .
so , people have the west really long time about creativity anticipated .
and then the renaissance and all changed to . we had this great idea . and this great idea was , let us the human individual in the center of the universe imagine -- about all the gods and mysteries . and there 's no room more for exquisite creatures , the commands by the divine think .
it 's the beginning of rational humanism , and the people began to believe that creativity completely off the own individual come .
the first time in history you 're listening people that or those artists a genius call -- instead of him , a genius did .
i must tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think , a very person to allow him , think , he or she was like the setting , like the pelvis and the essence , and the source of divinity , creative , <unk> , infinite <unk> is a little bit too much responsibility , you about a <unk> , human psyche <unk> .
it 's like someone to ask , the sun to swallow .
this <unk> and distorted big egos , and it generates all these <unk> expectations of the success .
i think that this <unk> our artists of the last 500 years shred , did .
and if , this is true , -- and i think it 's true -- is the question :
we can it change ?
maybe to a <unk> understanding about the relationship between humans and the mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we that <unk> from 500 years rational humanism not just in a <unk> talk knock out .

i 'll probably not all of them on this journey can take away .
but the question , i different models to is : why not ?
why not so thinking about it ?
because it 's as much sense like anything else , of that i 've heard , if it 's what was , the absolutely crazy <unk> <unk> of creative process to explain .
a process , of the -- like everybody knows , of it ever has been trying to do something -- so in other words , actually anyone here -- not going into ground .
in fact , he can be sometimes people <unk> feel .
i had recently such an encounter when i the extraordinary american poet <unk> stone met , the well over 90 is , the but all their lives for a poet was . they told me that you when you in <unk> virginia growing up out on the field was working . she said , they would feel and can hear like a poem about the landscape on them <unk> .
she said it would like a <unk> move from air ,
the about the country on them <unk> would .
they felt when it came , because it would the planet among their feet , for <unk> them .
they knew that you in one such as we just one could do . and that was -- in her words -- <unk> like the <unk> .
they placed like the devil , the house while you of this poem tracked was . it was only about that she quickly enough to a piece of paper and a pencil get to , so you it when it through them through <unk> , catch and on the slate onto could .
in other paint it was not fast enough . they ran and hurried and ran , but they reached the house n't and the poem of them were with them , and you missed it . she said it would go over country are moving and -- how they said -- <unk> a different poet <unk> .
and then there were these moments -- the part i 'll never forget -- they said , there have had in which they almost there missed .
so , she runs the house and looking after the paper and the poem goes through them , and she grabs a pencil just as it through them <unk> and then -- she said -- it was so when would with your other hand and then pick and it to into wars .
they <unk> the poem in its tail and moved it back in your body and took it on this piece of paper .
at those opportunity came the poem particularly and intact on paper on -- but backwards -- from last word for the first .
and when i heard i thought this is just creepy , that is exactly how my creative process <unk>
this is n't even as my creative process -- i 'm not the gowanus .
i 'm a <unk> . in order to work can i have to every day at the same time up and sweat , me who were struggling and really pretty uncomfortable <unk> .
but even i in my <unk> 've sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess , many of you this also have done .
even i did work or ideas that from a source of me <unk> , i really do n't identify can .
what is that for a thing ?
and how do we manage it in relationship with no about our minds to lose , but us in the opposite even in mental states are health to hold ?
for me is the best in an example , you that create can the musician and tom <unk> . i got him of years ago for a magazine interview .
we talked about about this topic . and you know what ? most of the time of his life was tom the embodiment of <unk> modern artist , of trying , these <unk> creative pulses , the in him resided , to control and with you cope .
but then he was older and goal was . he told me that he one day on a <unk> in los angeles , . and there changed , everything for him .
he went with high speed as he suddenly a little patch a melody sounds , the way that it at inspirations often is , for him agonizing to quite material is . and he wants to have them . it 's too . he <unk> then , but he ca n't go .
he 's not a piece of paper , it has n't pen , it has n't <unk> .
he starts so , this old <unk> in him to arise , such as . `` i 'm going to this thing lose and 'm going from this song on forever to be .
i 'm not enough , i can do it <unk>
but rather than in to panic whack , he stopped just on .
he finished all the line of thinking and doing something completely new .
he glanced at just in the sky , and <unk> , you ca n't see that i car ride ? ''
<unk> i like this out when i could just a song <unk> ?
if you really exist want to go , come to a <unk> hold back when i me to you care can .
if not , <unk> today , someone else .
go and <unk> leonard <unk>
his whole <unk> has to after that changed .
not the work itself . that was still a lot like this dark as time and ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> , the him around , was salvaged when he 's genius from out to see , where he does n't as trouble on and it up there <unk> where he sort of came from . he realized that 's not a skilled , <unk> thing be .
it was a <unk> , miraculous , bizarre working together give , sort of a conversation between tom and the <unk> , <unk> thing that not quite tom was .
when i this story about have changed it a bit of the way , as i worked and it , i 've even have saved .
this idea rescue me when i the middle of <unk> of <unk> , pray , <unk> was . i fell in one of this did all of <unk> in the we all these fall , if we at some work and it does n't . you <unk> on to think that 's a disaster is . this is the worst book , that ever was written .
not just bad , but the worst all time .
i started to think , i should the project just <unk> .
but then i remembered i remember , like tom , in the free sky was talking and i tried it .
i took so my view from the manuscript , and talked my comment on in to a vacuum corner of room .
i spoke out loud , <unk> to , you thing , you and i know both , if this book not brilliant is that 's not entirely my fault is , right .
because you see yes , i all what i have , <unk> . i did n't more than that .
if you so it better have to , you have here show up and your stake the <unk> indoor air-quality standards .
okay . but if , n't you do -- you know what , then the hell that .
i 'll still kept writing , because it 's my job .
and i want to go to protocol give , i today to my part of jobs here <unk>
because — — the end it 's how they follow . in centuries , and in the deserts <unk> people to <unk> with a dance and music spanning , the for hours ran were -- up to the <unk> .
those solid were always been great , because the meeting dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but in , and again , very rare , was something special . one of the performer actually got <unk> .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that they all in your life , even have such a performance have seen .
it was when would the time <unk> and the dancer walks through a kind <unk> step . he did n't help but when he 's ever before did -- a thousand nights earlier . but it added to meet .
and very suddenly appeared he did n't no longer in human .
he was from within lights up and of the bottom lights up and everything who lit up by a <unk> fire .
as such thing at that happened , knew the people what that was . they called it at his name .
they put the hands together and began to sing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , <unk>
this is god , you know ?
interesting historic footnote : when the <unk> <unk> cetaceans moved into they brought this practice with . the <unk> changed , in over the centuries of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that you still going to , <unk> and <unk> sounds .
when a performer in spain a <unk> , something magical has done , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> more , because it is : a glimpse to look at god .
and that 's great , because we need that .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , if the dancer itself wake up and out that it 11 o'clock at a tuesday is -- and he did n't no longer a <unk> of god in the wearing .
he 's just a an aging <unk> with <unk> kneel . and maybe he never again to these heights arise .
and maybe will never again , somebody 's name out , when he is human-centered . but what is he then with the rest of his life begin ?
that 's hard .
this is one of <unk> amending of a creative life .
but maybe it does not quite as full of <unk> be if you from the beginning to do n't believe have , the <unk> aspects of their existence of you do is .
if you might just think that you a <unk> are -- by a <unk> source for a <unk> time of your life , the to someone else down is , if you done with are .
if we start , so think about , that changes the first thing .
so i 've begun to think and so i think with safety in the last months , while i at the book working , which is going to appear to -- when the dangerous , <unk> , which had <unk> of my <unk> success .
what i 'm constantly even need to tell you , i about this crazy 'm going , is : did n't afraid .
do n't be discourages .
just do your job .
we continue for your contribution here , which also the he may be .
if your job that dance is , dance .
if , the dumb on genius , that you through the side which is to decide , for a short at a <unk> by miracles through your efforts to show , then <unk> ! ''
and if not , dance , your dance .
and <unk> ! '' for you despite all this .
i believe it and i 've felt that , we should that teach .
<unk> ! '' for you despite all this , just that , that you the mere human love and the <unk> did for that , there to be .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i have these two slides out , to illustrate , the arctic <unk> , the for nearly three million years the size of the bottom forty-eight states had , in 40 percent down is .
but that if not strong enough that in this particular problem , in there 's not the thickness of ice is .
in a sense is the arctic <unk> that beating heart of our global climate system .
she grows in winter and <unk> the summer .
the next slide that i show you , is a <unk> what in the last 25 years happened .
this <unk> is to red label .
as you see , you grow it on the dark blue shows marking . this is the annual ice in the wintertime ; and it <unk> the summer .
this so-called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which one of the body here <unk> .
in 25 years ago , it from here , here be gone .
this is a problem , since the warming the frozen reason for the arctic sea <unk> , where it large amounts of <unk> carbon is , which , when he <unk> , of microbes , methane implemented it .
compared with the entire amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , could to that amount double , if we this critical point cross .
already today <unk> in some flat lakes in alaska methane from ourselves from the water .
professor <unk> walter the university in alaska 's with another group to another one was lake last winter 've gone .
wow !
you all right . the question is how it going to anybody .
and one reason is , this tremendous reservoirs up greenland from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are much bigger than before .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you to know , like the sea through <unk> up here 's flowing them into the ocean .
those rivers so rapidly to .
at the other end of the planet , the antarctica , the biggest ice mass on planet .
last month had signed up now , that the entire continent now one negative <unk> has .
and the <unk> , the about a couple <unk> show up is , is particularly powerful in the melting .
this is 20 feet sea level , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> ice mass , you look up new lakes , the front of a few years glaciers were .
forty percent of people in the world get the half of your <unk> from this <unk> .
in the andes is this glacier the <unk> for this town .
the <unk> have to <unk> .
but if you <unk> , it also the most drinking water <unk> .
in california was a 40 percent reduction of <unk> the sierra seen .
this over the <unk> .
and the predict what they 're reading have , are seriously .
this <unk> in the world that leads to a dramatically increase in on fire .
and the disaster around the world have in a really <unk> and had never done <unk> increased .
times as many in the last 30 years as in the <unk> 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you this in the historical context of looking at , you can see what it <unk> .
in the last five years ago we 70 million tons of co2 produced all of 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
, look at the area of eastern pacific just on , by the american continent just west and both sides of indian <unk> , where it a <unk> decline of oxygen in the waters are .
the largest single factor for global warming , next to logging , which 20 percent is like , this is burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the equal parts biggest problem .
the united states are one of those major <unk> , together with china .
and the suggestion was , many more <unk> to build .
but we start , a change in .
here are the , the in the last years painted were , with some green alternatives , the suggested were .
yet notwithstanding there 's a political confrontation in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> dollars last <unk> spent , to clean coal to apply , what 's already , a contradiction in this is .
this picture reminded me of something .
for christmas around are running , with me to home in tennessee , a billion tons <unk> out .
they have it <unk> in the news seen .
this is in our whole country of <unk> <unk> america .
this happened to christmas .
one of ads the <unk> for christmas was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happy fellow .
it 's it in shell and wealth in america , and it helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> going every day clean .
he is affordable , and <unk> , and labor stay in wages , and bread .
this is the source of the most of coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the heads of massey coal .
let me a very clearly see . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry reid , they do n't know , which you talk .
so , the alliance for <unk> two campaigns to live launched .
this is one , a part of her .
at the <unk> we see <unk> as a serious at risk for our business .
so we have it us the top <unk> set , a <unk> <unk> spend about a <unk> on the way to bring in , the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not messy .
we think , it 's clean -- and it also still good
so , they 're doing is n't worry about the <unk> .
leave you take this us .
<unk> coal , they have a lot about this .
so let us a tour of modern , clean <unk> do .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it 's the sounds of clean <unk> .
and yet this burning of coal one of the main reasons for global warming is , the remarkable clean <unk> , that you see here , changes everything .
you look , it just on , this is that today , clean <unk> .
finally catches up to the positive alternative to our economic challenge and our challenge of the national security .
america 's in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the major thread , of these all together , is our dependence of <unk> <unk> like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there 's a courageous , new solutions , for us from this <unk> able to free .
<unk> america with 100 percent cleaner electricity new , within the next 10 years
a plan , america back to work to bring us , safe to make and to help , the global warming to stop .
finally , a solution , the big enough is , our to solve problems .
<unk> america new . you find more out .
this is the last .
it 's about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest way , our dependence of old , diapers <unk> , that our world choke , to reduce .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investing in , right from well-paid jobs to make .
<unk> america new . it 's time , reality to accept .
it 's an old african proverb saying , `` if you be fast want , go alone .
if you go far come want , get together . ''
we have far come , and it 's fast .
thank you .
so i want you start to ask , at the time your childhood <unk> , when you with <unk> played .
as they realized , you the hands out and <unk> , the <unk> pick up and moves , you learn in fact , to start thinking and problems through the understanding and change <unk> importance to solve .
the spatial think is closely with this connected , as we 're a great deal of our environment understand .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of our interaction with real objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> <unk> , i started to me wonder : what would be , if we use computers were , that instead of a <unk> , of , as a digital <unk> on a flat <unk> goes ... ... , what if we with both hands intervene could and data were taking and you so order could , what 's what we want ?
this question was so emotional , we us to exploration of the answer to and <unk> evolved .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of <unk> .
they do with the hands moved to be , you can to each other well , you can their movements capture and they have a screen and a <unk> .
much more importantly , they 're physically , so you 're like <unk> merely by that reach the hands and tap into can move .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to which digital data .
and if these tools <unk> be and a consciousness for their movements that , to each other recognize and the intricacies of our <unk> with you see , then we can with the study of new and <unk> <unk> start .
i 'll start with some simple examples of .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and when i him in a direction <unk> , will it goes forward played back ; if i him in the other direction <unk> , is it backwards .
and this interactive for portraits take to each other true .
if i you so next 'll , punctuality that their interest .
if you <unk> are surrounded by , realizing it 's also , and can little nervous to .
and you feel as their movements and slope .
an interesting a result of interactions , that we to see started , was that we everyday gestures on data which could , how about color so to them , you this with <unk> does .
in this case we three <unk> as <unk> <unk> and i can you use to paint in the in the middle of like , where they then mixed to .
if we it little , we can be a little <unk> .
it 's also , some nice opportunities in education as languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we the people the possibility of fast <unk> give and the results , to see .

this is a game with words , that a mixture of <unk> and <unk> is .
so basically you get every once in any <unk> happened to <unk> letters and as you try , words to form , are these about a dictionary not-quite-right .
then after about 30 seconds , is back up and you have a new <unk> and new ways to explore this .
thank you .
this is some children who on a trip to the media lab coming . i could get you move , it 's try and have a video of taken .
they have it really loved .
an interesting fact , at this kind of applications is that you the people not a lot of instructions to give .
all you need to tell is `` you words '' and you know exactly what to do .
here are still a couple of the people 's test .
this is our youngest <unk> down there right .
it turns out , he the <unk> just stack wanted .
so for him they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted a <unk> for world-class language learner develop .
this is named hausdorff .
he can new characters in the scene them , by he the <unk> the table <unk> , of those figure shows .
so let 's the sun rise .
the sun goes on
now , puts it a <unk> in the scene .

good job ! yeah .
by he the <unk> shake and it together puts it ca the characters are interacting so ...
-- his own story invent .
hello !
it 's a story with open up and he can decide , and as you up .
flying cat .
the last example , for that i now time have , it to show , is a <unk> for <unk> , that we recently have evolved and in the <unk> as sound like , <unk> , bass , and drums act .
each has four different variations ; you can choose , which you wants to use .
and you can these sounds in the sequence <unk> , you again in any patterns order can .
and you <unk> you a , by just a <unk> to a <unk> stops .
there are effects , you live can change , such as . hall and filter .
you connect him with a particular sound and tends to then to hire .
and then even larger effects like speed and loudness , you on the entire sequence in .
so we look at times .
we start , where we the <unk> in two <unk> <unk> and this in a lot of order , they expand and a bit more of the voice to it .
now i add some a bass it .
now i 'll still a drums and to do .
and now just i the filters to the drums , so i the effect on control how can .
i can all the sequence now , by i the speed in the one or other direction <unk> .
and now just i the filter , with the bass , for something more expression .
i can the sequence happens when she is all change .
so i have to do you in <unk> plan , but can improvise , you and increase or time .
and closing i can all the sequence <unk> , by i the <unk> left , tend .
thank you .
so as you can see , is my desire in it , new <unk> to develop the better on to fit , like our brains and bodies operate .
and today i had time , you a part of these new <unk> and some of possibilities of to show , what we in our lab work .
the idea that i them with on the way give me , is that we 're at the threshold to this new generation of <unk> to interact with digital media are , the information in our world into , that our needs to .
thank you ,
i 'm me on the conversations with you all !
