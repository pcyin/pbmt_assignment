when steve lopez , columnist the los angeles times , one day through the streets in the center of los angeles went , he heard about a wonderful music .
they came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , somewhere , homeless , the on a violin playing , the only have two strings had .
many of you 're going to the story know , because of <unk> article about it was later a book , it again <unk> was with , robert <unk> junior when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as <unk> anthony <unk> , the <unk> , at the <unk> studied and its very promising career tragically early by your with paranoid schizophrenia was ended .
<unk> left <unk> , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , dry it as homeless on the streets of <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend you all , <unk> book to read or to the film to watch , so you do n't just the wonderful connectedness , understand the between those two men 's happened is , but also , like the music that link to helped and how they finally , this instrument was , if this pun allows is that 's <unk> , <unk> away from the road to get .
i met mr <unk> in 2008 , in two years ago , in the walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a performance of <unk> first and <unk> symphony heard and got behind the stage , in order to me to imagine .
he talked in a very <unk> and <unk> tone of yo-yo ma , hillary clinton , and about how the dodgers it 's ever in the bigs world series that would . and that all for the <unk> passage of the first violin in the last sentence of <unk> <unk> symphony .
we came to talk about music to talk . and a few days later i got an email , in the state , that <unk> , for <unk> with me interested .
i have to even mention that <unk> a medical treatment and turned down , because he was already with <unk> and with <unk> and <unk> treated been , a trauma , that it all his life to have .
as a consequence of that he is now , especially vulnerable to these schizophrenics periods . that are sometimes that bad , and it for days away , in the streets of <unk> row <unk> , and this horror and the <unk> of his own mind -- aged .
and in just one <unk> was to <unk> , when we with our first class in the walt disney <unk> hall started . he had this just mind-boggling flickering in his eyes and seemed completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how to somebody in sleep being wanted .
i was afraid , not <unk> , but i was afraid , i him lose could him , in one of conditions <unk> could and that i him his relate to violin destroy could , if i started about , <unk> and <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> <unk> to talk .
i started so easy to to play .
i was the first set of <unk> <unk> .
and while i was , occurred to me , that in <unk> eyes a <unk> change in the left .
it was , as if it under the impact of an invisible <unk> said , a chemical response , the catalyst my game was .
<unk> <unk> anger turning to in understanding , in a quiet for curiosity and <unk> .
and how by a miracle he took his violin and started , to be heard some excerpts from <unk> to play and asked me then , them out to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started then on , about music to talk , starting from stream of beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , of <unk> up to <unk> <unk> .
and i became clear that he did n't just a <unk> know about music owned , but it with you also a tight personal relationship combined .
he spoke of her with a passion and a sense , that i would just by my colleagues in the philharmonic , of los angeles know .
by his music playing and about music back , was from this <unk> , confused man , the right now , through the streets of los angeles to was , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> <unk> musicians have become .
music 's medicine . music changes us .
for <unk> means music <unk> health .
because the music it allows him , his thoughts and delusions to help his imagination and creativity in a real <unk> .
and so <unk> he his <unk> situation .
i understood that 's what this the essence of art is .
exactly this is the reason why we music making : so we something that in all of us , deep inside any shape , our feelings , by our artistic lens , through our creativity to actually shape can .
and the fact that expression of us all , and moves , inspired by and unites us .
what <unk> <unk> , it took him the music back in a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music took him back in a family of musicians , that it realized , the be talent realized and it quantitative data .
and i 'm going back with <unk> make music , no matter whether in the walt disney <unk> hall , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me is , why i musicians have become am .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want something play , that i <unk> the <unk> you have .
i hope you 'll excuse me .
so i have in my life many fishes <unk> .
i just two loved .
this one that this was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a more fish , <unk> good , consistency , <unk> , a best-selling on the menu card .
what a fish .
even better , he was in <unk> after the walk up standards of sustainability down .
you could , and so i think about it feel , it to sell .
i had to this beauty a sense of several months .
one day she called the head of the company , and said , if i at one event <unk> could about the sustainability of the farm .
`` course , '' said .
there was a company that to solve was trying to do , this important issue for our chefs 's gone . how do n't we fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years have the sea fish out of how we forests <unk> beaten have .
it 's hard , the destruction of <unk> .
ninety percent of the big fish , of , that we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , the salmon , this swordfish , they 're collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more left .
so going to guess or bad <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future be .
a lot of arguments against it . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
this is , 15 pounds supports wild fish are necessary , so you a pounds <unk> get .
not very sustainable .
theyâ€™re not too much good .
so here was finally one company that was trying to , it right to do .
i wanted you have .
the day before the event i called the head of <unk> for the company in .
we call him don .
`` well , don , '' i said , `` just about the facts right to have , you are famous for it , so far out the sea grow , that you the environment n't polluted . ''
`` this is true , '' he said . `` we 're so far out , that the waste from our fish you will , not focused . ''
and then put it to , `` we are basically a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one what ? what into her ? ''
`` how sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` wow , '' said . put on .
and that night i was in bed and thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the day , just before the event , don in .
i said , `` don , which for example are sustainable proteins ? ''
he said , he know that not . he 'll <unk> .
now , i <unk> with a few people in the company . nobody could me a proper answers to be . until i finally with the senior biologists <unk> .
we call him as well don .
`` well , don , '' i said , `` what for example are sustainable proteins ? ''
well , he said some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , putting feathers , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and to its food processing . ''
i said , `` how much of your consume 's chicken ? well ,
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` don , which is being remember , chicken at the fish to feed ? ''
there 's a long break in the leadership and he said , `` there 's just too chicken in the world . ''
i <unk> me from this fish .
no , not because i a <unk> <unk> and <unk> am .
that i 'm actually .
no , i 've <unk> actually from this fish <unk> , because , i swear to , god , the fish to this entertainment , chicken <unk> has .
that second fish , that 's a different kind of <unk> .
it 's the romantic sort , the way , the , you ever better you his fish ; learn , you the fish 's more love .
i have him at first in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
one than our a reporter had been thinking about of this fish were .
it has to sort <unk> .
he came on the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had him <unk> .
hold twice .
astonishingly , he was still , delicious .
who can a fish that well taste let , after he <unk> was ?
i ca n't it , but this guy can it .
we call him miguel . actually means he miguel .
and no , he 's the fish do n't cooked , and he 's not a chef . at least on the way , that you and i have understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner <unk> .
it is near the <unk> of the river <unk> .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they grew <unk> on the , which basically the wetlands were .
they made it by them the country <unk> .
they built this complicated result of channels , and they urged water from the land out and out into the river .
now , they could n't do , that it was fine , not cost-effective .
and ecological it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of birds in order , which for this place many birds are .
and so , 1982 a spanish company with environmental bought that land .
what you 've done ?
they have the river of water in reverse .
they 've literally the lever <unk> .
instead of the water <unk> did they the channels , in the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created an eleven thousand acre <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , eel that -- and i 've miguel , and his company the environmental destruction completely other way .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they have such thing is ever seen .
you stare out on the horizon , of a million miles away is , and everything you see are <unk> channels and this dense , billowing march .
i was there was n't really long time with miguel .
he is an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and part of `` a crocodile to kiss . ''
okay ? because we were and struggled to us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , have mud up to my down , and miguel holding in peace one <unk> .
here 's it a rare <unk> out .
now talk about it the <unk> of phytoplankton .

and it turns out that miguel the most of his career in <unk> national park in africa has spent .
i asked him , he 's to such a <unk> 's gone .
he said , `` fish ? i know nothing about a fish .
i 'm an expert of relationships . ''
and then it 's it and plummets , in more going of those rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and they get me not wrong , this was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this <unk> piece <unk> fish , that i at <unk> had .
so i it stopped . i said , `` miguel , how is it that your fish that well taste ? ''
he showed up on the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , it 's unbelievable .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
well , he goes on to tell me , it 's a rich set system is that the fish eat what you in the wild food were .

the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
it 's no food .
and of a farm heard , the their animals not into ?
later on day i went on this site with miguel around and i asked him , i said , `` for a place , the way of course , seems to be , '' different than any farm , on the i ever been was , `` what 's you succeeding ? ''
in the moment , it was as if a <unk> a <unk> to have .
and we came to the corner and we provided to the most amazing sight , thousands and going <unk> flamingos covered , a literally <unk> carpet so far the eye is enough .
`` it 's success , '' he said .
`` look out their <unk> on , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was a very confused .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> you 're not your fish ? ''
`` yes , he said .
`` we lost 20 percent of our fish and <unk> at the birds .
now , last year were on this site 600,000 birds , more than 100 different species .
it 's now the largest and one of the most important private <unk> in all across europe has become .
i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last , that you on a <unk> have to ? ''
he <unk> his head , no .
he said , `` we build <unk> on , not hard .
this is a <unk> network .
the flamingos covered eat the shrimp are .
the shrimp are eat the phytoplankton .
and <unk> so the belly the better the system . ''
okay , let us that come . a farm , the their animals not into and a farm , the their success on the health of predator image is measuring .
a <unk> , but a <unk> .
oh , and by the way to these flamingos covered by first n't even be there .
they breed in a city 240 miles away , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning fly you 240 kilometers to farm .
and every night fly you 240 miles back .
they do this because they the <unk> white line the highway <unk> follow .
in fact .
i had to sort of a journey of penguins had imagined , so i looked at miguel in .
i said , `` miguel , fly you 240 kilometers to the farm and fly and then you 240 miles back at night ?
do that for kids ? ''
he looked at me , as if i just a song of whitney houston quoted .
he said , `` no . they do this because the food is better . ''
i did n't the skin of my beloved fish mentioned , the delicious was , and i do n't like <unk> . i like they do n't <unk> . i like they do n't crisp .
it 's this positively scathing about , <unk> flavor .
i 'm cooking almost never with this .
and yet , when i them in this restaurant in <unk> attempted , she did n't even after <unk> <unk> .

i mentioned that to miguel , and he kind of nodded .
he said , `` the skin it looks like a sponge .
it is the last the , until something in the body into .
and she over the course of evolution evolved in , <unk> <unk> . ''
and then put it to , `` but our water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm , the your fish do n't baseball . a farm , the their success measures at the success of predator image .
and then i was right , when he says , a farm , that do n't <unk> has , <unk> he really big , because the water , that through this farm will come from the river <unk> gets .
it 's a river , of all the things with it leads , of those rivers , now to have , you with , to lead , chemical pollutants , runoff from <unk> .
and if there is through the system fought , and this leaves is the water cleaner , as how it <unk> is .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water that .
so not just a farm , the their animals do n't she feeds , not just a farm , the their success on the health of predator image measures , but a farm , the literally a <unk> is , and not just for those fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take him , and that they should also do , because these <unk> , what romantic , whatever , is also telling .
you might say that you a recipe is for the future good food , whether we of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what now we need is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the foods really good delicious .
but for many people that 's a little bit of radical .
we 're not <unk> , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we 're talking about regional food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that this stuff that are , the the future good food that 's somebody somewhere up and says , `` hey guys , i love pink flamingos covered , but how they will feed the world ?
how they will feed the world ? ''
i must be honest ?
i like this is not .
no , not because we 've been many calories are producing , the world to more than just to feed .
one billion people are today <unk> .
one billion -- that 's more than before -- because <unk> disparities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i like this question , not because they the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years about activities has .
these grain of <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , chemicals at the earth , chicken at the fish , and the time has the agribusiness just wondered : `` if we 're more people less feed , how awful it can already be ? ''
this was the <unk> . it was the justify it . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should they say , which it 's , a industry-relevant in <unk> , a industry-relevant , that fast <unk> capital <unk> , that 's what this production to .
this is not industry-relevant , and it is n't agriculture .
our <unk> is today face , not due <unk> <unk> , but because <unk> resources ,
not from the latest <unk> and <unk> , it by fertile country , not by pumps , but through fresh water , not with chainsaws , it by forests , and not by <unk> and nets , it by fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let us begin with the question : how we 're going to feed itself ?
or better , how we can conditions do , that every community enable themselves , to feed ?
in order to do , you look not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are at <unk> and it has never something really good for food produced .
so let 's what the green model in .
this is that , this on two billion years <unk> <unk> .
look at that miguel , , farmers like miguel ,
businesses , not that worlds for you are , factories , that restore instead <unk> , factories , the <unk> grow rather than just hard , farmers , the not just second-highest are , but experts to develop relationships ,
because they are the ones that also become experts to flavor is .
and if i really honestly , they 're a better chef when i it ever be going to .
you know , that 's my right , because if that the future good food is , you , delicious be .
thank you .
if i you today one thing with me is it , the totality of data , that we consume , bigger than the sum of bits and instead of it to <unk> to think i want , that you think about how we information that can use , that the pattern up and we so trends actually see , that would not visible become were .
so , what we see here 's a typical <unk> to age arranged .
this program that i here use , is a little experiment .
it 's called <unk> and what i with <unk> can do is that i after a certain killer of filters can say , we accident .
and instantly i see a different patterns , that it does .
and it , because in <unk> here people at the <unk> are and you over here at <unk> are .
we can one more step out and reorganize the data and then , and see that <unk> and cancer the usual suspects are , but not for everyone .
if we now go and to age <unk> , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accident , even the leading cause is about the , the people worry should do .
and who <unk> see that this is especially in men are true .
we 're very well , that watch it of information and data in this way very to swim in a living <unk> it does .
and if we this for raw data can do why do n't even for content itself ?
what we now have here are the front covers every single `` espn <unk> , '' the ever printed were .
it 's all here . it 's everything online .
you can it like to my talk in their <unk> test .
with <unk> you can agenda in a decade .
you can agenda in a particular year .
and you could directly to a certain copy one .
now if i here at , i see the athletes , the in this issue comes out and the <unk> .
i 'm a lance armstrong fan , so click i go to make me all spending show in which have lance armstrong mentioned will .
now , if i just a <unk> touch of getting to , can i think `` okay , what if i 'm all with the theme <unk> look at ? ''
so i one step back and <unk> the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of them , that if you in that way information is a piece , <unk> , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , then you find not or <unk> not only .
you do something that actually a little bit different .
it 's something between , and we think it changes the way of how information can be used .
i 'd like this idea now a little further do with about what a little crazy is .
so what we 've done is that we have any one <unk> , and it on a little summary reduced .
the summary of a quick <unk> and a symbol for the realm of the it 's coming .
i 'm just for the top 500 of <unk> <unk> .
but even in this <unk> think we can be a lot of things do .
now we get a sense of the stories , on the wikipedia at <unk> are .
i 'm now the issue <unk> '' vote .
now , after i <unk> ' elected , know i that the <unk> , and the most with it needs to <unk> `` people of the year . ''
this is really important , there is an insight is , the not in a single <unk> out .
it 's just to see if you one step back and the entire at .
<unk> on a certain that <unk> i can then in the issue . <unk> `` people of the year '' into it go , and all meet those .
now if i all these people consider know i that the majority of <unk> are . some people come from the science . some , even less , come from the economy . here is my head . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , is bono , a ted prize winner .
so we can now jump , and take a look at all of ted prize winner 's .
you see , we 're surfing on the web the first time as if it also really a net is not just by side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want you what else show what a little surprise be .
i 'll show you is simply just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i want it 's not a browser call it ; it 's really not a browser , but you can websites to look at -- and we bring these <unk> to every single website as this .
so i one step back , and directly to a particular unit jump .
this is that matters because you just by that look at the web pages in this way of , all the <unk> on the same way of looking at can .
so i in my trajectory zoom in a certain <unk> .
here 's the state of the u.s. demonstration , i up here that have .
and i can sort of all what i now been considered , again , back .
and , if i again one step go away and on all know , i can my trajectory in order maybe for my <unk> . here , i have to <unk> , looking , here , bing , right here to live labs <unk> .
and from here i can in the site into and it back up .
it 's a metaphor , the time again 's used , and every time it makes this big picture bigger than the sum of <unk> .
in the moment , in the world , we think , that data a curse those are .
we talk from the cursing the <unk> .
we talk from `` are drowned in information . ''
what if we this situation turn around could and the internet on its head imagine , so that we instead , from one for others to go , start by many things to many things go to do , and this pattern can see , what otherwise , hidden behind them were ?
if we do that can , then becomes this exceeds <unk> , maybe a new source go through information .
and , instead , just only in information to move , we know from this time .
and if we do you know , then we can maybe even wisdom and move .
so i hear on , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> <unk> science fiction on .
in my high school i went to the bus to school , every day an hour a route .
and my nose stuck , in a book , a <unk> , that my mind in other worlds <unk> and on <unk> in my deep in my social , voracious curiosity <unk> .
these curious which is also in that i always , if i do n't in school was , by the forests <unk> , walking and `` samples '' collected , frogs and snakes and beetles , and <unk> , all home to put and under the microscope looked at .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was at all around the trial , the world to understand and the boundaries of sorts of explore the .
and my love to science fiction seemed to in my environment <unk> , because back in the late '60s , we went to the moon and in the ocean .
jacques cousteau came in our living with his amazing tv , that we animals and places and a world of wonder know , that we we 'd never would imagine .
that has then i just fine to that <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's neither video games have these <unk> with <unk> movies , all the imagery in the media landscape was , i needed the images in my mind make .
that we had at all . if we as kids a book read , we took the way of the author 's and <unk> them on the screen in our minds .
my response to that was the drawing and paint by aliens , alien worlds , robots , spacecraft and all like that .
in class , i was constantly from teachers get caught , as i , behind the textbook on , <unk> .
the creativity to stop somehow get out .
and it was done something interesting . what i which is to jacques <unk> tv being , was the idea of a 's completely unseen world here at our planet itself .
i 'm sure i 'd like i never an alien world with a spaceship way . it seemed to me very unlikely .
but there was a world that i actually enter could , here on earth , and she was also fascinating and exotic as how all this , what i 'm always imagined was now , those books had read .
so i decided , when i was 15 , bounce to be .
the only problem with it was that i in a small village in canada lived , a 1,000 kilometers from the ocean from .
of that i let me , but not <unk> .
i <unk> my father , until he finally one <unk> in <unk> , new york , out an 've done , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> the middle of the winter in <unk> , new york .
the ocean but , a real ocean , i received only two years later to face , when we to california doing .
since then , in the 40 years , the now <unk> are , i have about three thousand hours of water spent . 500 hours of them in <unk> .
and i 've learned that the world the deep sea , even the <unk> oceans , so rich in <unk> life is how we it 's really hardly imagine .
the imagination of nature 's no borders , quite the contrary to our own , <unk> human imagination .
until the modern day excited i deepest awe of that what i on my <unk> see .
and my love to the ocean holding on , with the same intensity as time and ever .
when i 'm then as an adult a profession <unk> , it was the <unk> .
it seemed the best way , my inner drive , stories to tell , with my need , images to create , to unite .
as a child do i always comic books and so .
so , movies of the way , images and stories <unk> . that fit together .
now been the stories that i 'm <unk> , from the <unk> , `` terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> . ''
so , `` <unk> '' i could my penchant for the <unk> and that dip to the <unk> together .
so intertwined in sort of my two passions .
something interesting happened to , `` <unk> '' : in a <unk> problem in this film to solve -- and that we had this kind of liquid <unk> create -- , picked up , we computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
what we came out , was the first computer-generated <unk> to ever in a film to see was .
the film gave it 's no money one , just being played are he 's for his <unk> a , but i realized something fascinating , the audience on the world was like mesmerized by the magic , of them went down .
according to arthur clarke 's law are you know <unk> technology and magic does n't more from one to tell .
they saw so something magical .
and that i found immensely exciting .
and i thought me , `` wow , this must have in the <unk> be involved . ''
so we went in `` terminator two , '' my next movie , much more on .
together with <unk> created we there the guy from liquid metal . of success were all of them off , like this effect get there would .
and it worked . again , we had something magical created . and the impact in the audience was the same . but we have to the movie , for a bit more money <unk> .
of these two experiences from , was a new world is , a new world of creativity to <unk> .
so i founded a company , together with my good friend stan winston , the to at that time the best <unk> and <unk> was . it was called `` digital <unk> . ''
the idea of this company , it was the stage <unk> processes with visual <unk> etc . to skip and the same with digital <unk> to start .
did that we then , and <unk> us so for a while a competitive advantage .
but in the 1990s years we realized yet , we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company that itâ€™s basically founded had -- to start to <unk> .
i had this piece `` avatar '' written , that the <unk> in things visual effects and <unk> effects in whole new heights 're supposed , with lifelike human , <unk> characters , the using <unk> made been were . and the <unk> should all <unk> be . and the world to <unk> be .
but the <unk> put quite beautiful back . and people in my company told me that we <unk> n't even in the able to be , that to make .
so , shifted at i that and made this other film about the big ship , that goes down .
the <unk> i have this as `` romeo and juliet on a ship '' sells . it was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a passionate film .
secretly but i wanted to actually , for real cover up the titanic immerse ourselves .
why i the film did .
this is the truth . the studio knew that but not .
i 've but they convinced , by i said , `` we 're on to cover up . we filming the real cover up .
we will it in the <unk> of which show .
this is hugely important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i <unk> you , an expedition to fund .
sounds crazy . but that goes back on it back , that your imagination a reality that can .
we created and indeed , six months later a reality , in the i 'm in a russian <unk> <unk> , four kilometers of the surface of north atlantic , and me the real titanic through a <unk> was .
it was no movie , not a high definition from , that was real .
so , that i was really my world .
and the preparation that were huge . we had to cameras and spotlight , and all sorts of building .
and to me , how much these <unk> , one <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you go up in the capsule , it 's you in this dark , <unk> environment down , where no hope to rescue is , if you do n't it yourself back does .
and i thought , `` wow , which is the same way , as if i was in a <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was , obsessed by studying the deep sea .
anyway , of the part , the with curiosity and science has to do . it was it . it was exploring , it was curious . it was imagination .
and it was an experience to me , hollywood would n't be able .
because , you know , i was able to me a creature imagine , for that we then a visual effect is able to . but i could n't imagine that , what i outside the <unk> would see .
some , the next expeditions to have i being in <unk> seen , and sometimes things that i have never seen before had , sometimes even things that even still no one before had seen of and that science to the moment , when we saw , actually , no words had found .
that i was so right <unk> , and i wanted more .
and so i met then a something unusual decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' i told me , `` okay , i want my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood to ice , and 'm going to a while <unk> . ''
and we then , we up to `` bismarck , '' and they were exploring with <unk> .
we returned to cover up the titanic transition back .
we were little robot , that we built were , the a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and to the inside of the ship to watch , which never been done had been .
nobody had ever that inside of <unk> been explored . you 'd still no means that . so we evolved the any technology .
well , and there sitting i now , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> , that these <unk> is quite similar and of which i know that once the band and played has .
and i am with a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i <unk> it 's actually just , but my consciousness is within the <unk> .
and it felt at , as if i was physically within the <unk> the titanic there .
this was the <unk> shape of <unk> , i ever have experienced . because before i each about a corner bends , i knew i always been , which is the same in <unk> of <unk> actually would that i <unk> about <unk> had was when we the movie around .
this set , which is an exact copy of <unk> of the ship .
so that was a very own experience .
they made me this <unk> know that you such <unk> <unk> use and so that own consciousness in the car , in these different form of existence embarrassed can .
it was actually incredibly profound
and maybe even a small view on that which may be in a few decades could happen , if you <unk> has , in something to explore or other things to do , in all sorts of <unk> <unk> , i me as <unk> can imagine .
after these expeditions to we started this , what we down there had seen , really appreciate to learn for instance , these <unk> , where we these an amazing animals saw . that 's sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live with help of chemosynthesis .
they are not in a to sunlight point system , how we do .
and so you see animals that right next to a 500 degrees celsius say that they survive there can .
the same time was interested i 'm also very for <unk> , that was back of <unk> from my childhood .
and so i ended up with people , and for space interested and the with the nasa have to do and in <unk> sit and right <unk> planning . you go to russia , go before the mission the biomedical enterprise protocol branching , drum and off , fly and the international <unk> and take our <unk> with .
this was fascinating .
but the end it was looking out , i <unk> with us in the ocean took .
i took them with and <unk> you access to the world down there , <unk> , <unk> , the people , for such extreme conditions interesting . i took them to the sources with , so you to look around , samples , and instruments how could and so forth .
we turned it <unk> , by but actually science , more specifically , <unk> .
so lock , the circle between my existence as <unk> , back as a child , and the execution in the reality .
in over these <unk> have a lot of learned .
i have a lot about science learned . but now i think they certainly , a director making a can lead , a leader be like a <unk> or so .
i understood but not a lot of leadership , before i these expeditions to <unk> .
because at a certain point i had to tell me , `` what i 'm actually here ?
why i do it ? what comes out of it ? ''
these down on movies take us no money .
we play time just the <unk> a . of fame not a trail .
all think , that i was between `` titanic '' and `` avatar '' <unk> and have to me some of nails on a towel the beach <unk> .
i 've all these films , these <unk> , for a very small audience did .
not a fame , not honor , no money . what do you just ?
you 're doing it about the task will , in the challenge will -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , that it 's . you 're doing it of <unk> because , and because of the weird to link , that occurs when a small group of people a team is .
because we 've all this with only 10 to 12 people did , the years non-stop on have . sometimes we were two or three months if at sea .
and in this community you see , the most important thing that be aware is , you , each other has , because you a task . has , you any other things can explain .
if you on land back and it says , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , the <unk> , and that all around , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human <unk> , if you at sea is working , '' then you the other just do n't explain . it 's the police or with soldiers , the things together have gone through and know that it 's never anyone can explain .
there 's a link , a each other respect .
when i so came back , for my next movie `` avatar '' to turn , i tried the leadership to employ , which is that you his team respected and , in return of respect deserves .
it was the dynamic really changed .
because i was so again with a small team on <unk> <unk> . we were `` avatar '' with a new technique that it first , not there .
immensely exciting .
an incredible challenges .
and we were for a period of half years to a real family .
it changed , my way , films to do , completely .
there 's the people said , we have these <unk> itâ€™s really good <unk> and on the planet even pandora transport .
for me it more a <unk> way , my job to do , the actual process , the to the result has changed .
what we can so from all the end ?
lessons that we 've learned ?
i think , at first is the curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human quality .
our imagination is a force , that even a reality that can .
and the arterial your team is important than all <unk> this world .
come to me kid filmmaker , the say , `` give me a advice , as i do this can . ''
and i say , `` <unk> you do n't even a .
and put a different for you . do n't it to yourself in , bet not against to itself . but take risks on you . ''
the nasa 's such a <unk> , `` failure is not an alternative . ''
but in art and the study has to fail an alternative to be , because there guarantee it a <unk> .
no big endeavor , this innovation insisted , ever been no risk of neighborhoods .
you must be willing , these risks on , to take .
it 's the idea that i you like with on the way give me . failure is quite an alternative , fear but is no . thanks .
now i talk to you about energy and climate .
and that by maybe something , because , my <unk> at the foundation mainly about vaccines , and seed is , in the things that we create and provide need to the poorest two billion a better life to enable .
but energy and climate are extremely important for those people , just took even more than for each other on planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> over many years n't grow to . it 's too much or to some rain . the things are going to this change , how it 's their fragile environment not withstand can .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , is a <unk> terrible for you 're going .
what 's the <unk> for you very important .
in fact , that if you just from one thing at the will be , to <unk> would be energy far and at the most effective .
well the <unk> is over time like .
actually based the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> pushing the industrial revolution , and ourselves over the 20th century . there was a <unk> case in <unk> and why we <unk> , <unk> , we can modern materials manufacture and so many things do .
we find ourselves and so in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we the price of -- we let us at the half -- we meet in a new barrier and this barrier on with carbon together .
co2 warmed the planet and the equation for carbon is actually pretty clear .
they <unk> that <unk> co2 , which to <unk> leads , and these <unk> has some very negative follow . effects on the weather and maybe getting worse , the an indirect result that the natural ecosystems , such <unk> changes not to do and this whole systems lifetime .
well the exact same relationship between a <unk> and the it caused <unk> and where the other consequences are , there is some <unk> , but not very many .
and there are safe <unk> about how bad those consequences will . but they 're very bad be .
i have the <unk> several times asked , `` we really need down to near zero come ?
does n't the half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we 're near zero come , is the temperature and keep up .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a 3.5 feet high truck , the under a 3 feet bridge on up to . the then you can put it up just .
so this has to way to the bottom , to zero .
now , we hit each year a lot of carbon out about , 26 billion tons .
what ? about 20 tons . people out of poor countries , less than one .
the average is it about five tons for everyone on planet .
and somehow we need to change out , the that to zero down .
it 's been my language up .
just different economic changes have about it 's and we need of <unk> rise to reduction go and to a reduction up to zero .
this equation , four factors . a little <unk> . you have this thing left -- co2 -- this , it towards zero to want and that 's going from the number of people depend on , of the service , the person has the average use , of an energy for any service and the co2 , that a <unk> <unk> will .
let us so every single factor of individually and look out , we like us that to zero get .
probably needs to one of these numbers very close to zero come .
now this is the basic algebra , but we do it 's in .
so we have the population .
now live 6.8 billion people ,
and it proceeding at 9 billion to . on the nine billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we could that i think about 10 percent to 15 percent down , but the time we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second factor is the services , that we use .
that includes all , the food , that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
that are very good things and <unk> means , those services almost every on planet accessible to do .
it 's great , this number drops .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could be <unk> do , less use , but the average will this number every year go up and , so in more than double , the number of services the per person put together .
here we have a very basic services . you have to home light , so you the homework can read ?
and those students have n't it , so they go out and reading your schoolwork whatsoever under the <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , you have finally good news .
we have something that not going up ,
because of success in <unk> , in other <unk> , in new ways in <unk> , there 's a lot of services , whose <unk> some of those services let 's about 90 percent down .
in other service , like the manufacture of <unk> , 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , is the window closes for improvement very much smaller .
overall , if we optimistic is , we get maybe one is to a factor of three or maybe even for a factor of six .
but for the first three factors , we 're now of 26 billion in may <unk> 13 billion tons of gone . and that 's just not out !
let 's so the fourth factor of -- and this is a x-factor in his -- this is the amount of co2 , the per <unk> <unk> will .
and it turns the question , whether you that to zero can get .
if you coal burn , no .
if you natural gas burn , no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> today , co2 , except the renewable energy and <unk> .
so what we on a global level have to do , is , a new system to make .
we need <unk> .
now if i the term `` wonders '' use , i mean not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and of services is a miracle .
the people have here to the evolution of many of this miracle contributed .
usually 's no <unk> , you a miracle up to a certain date needs .
normally what you basically just wrong and some people who are different , not .
in this case we need to but <unk> give and a miracle in very long time getting ?
now , i asked me , how do i really that <unk> ?
there 's a natural <unk> , a demonstration , the the idea of people here heat ?
i think back at me last year , when i viewed was somehow , liked the people that .
the idea was for you really accessible , you know , there are there , the to mosquitos life .
for energy i noticed that 's a .
i decided that this <unk> of fireflies make my <unk> contribution to the environment would be here .
so here 's a couple of natural fireflies .

now , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but you get all not much .
we need solutions , either one or a couple of the an incredible scale and most incredible <unk> have . and even though it many ways there , in which people to seek , i look really just five , that these huge demand can afford .
i 've <unk> , <unk> , merger and better biofuels <unk> .
this for maybe a <unk> contributions and if you better do when i expect , that would be great , but my punch line here is that we at all those five to work , and we ca n't of you give up , because it 's <unk> , because all have significant problems .
so let 's first of the burning fossil fuels in , burning of either coal or natural gas .
what you there are doing to , it may simply , but this is no . you 'd have all the co2 , that after the burning of the <unk> comes to catch , under pressure <unk> and then some place them and hope , that there 's left .
it 's a pilot projects , that it on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level create , but it on 100 percent to get is very difficult to . and one where for the storage out of the co2 to make , is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who it will make sure ?
who can something guarantee , which literally a billion times bigger than any kind of waste , the you , of <unk> and other things can imagine ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that 's a tough cracked nut .
as a thing : <unk> .
the also has three major problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries are high . the question after security , you really feel , that nothing wrong can walk , despite the human voluntary cooperation , that the fuel not for weapons 's used .
and what makes you then with the garbage ?
because even though he did n't 's very large , there 's a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be solvable are , and at that you that work to .
the past three of five , i 've summarized .
it 's the renewable energy , as you often be called .
and the have -- although it 's awesome is that you any fuel need -- you have some downsides .
for one is the <unk> , that these technologies create dramatic lower than the of <unk> .
this is that <unk> , you 're talking from many <unk> , thousand times more land than a normal power station .
and it these vents disruption .
the sun shines not the day , it seems too , not every day and as easy , the wind not the time .
so you have , if you of these vent sites on , is a way have , the energy , in times when they 're not available is to get .
it 's so here , big <unk> . there 's going on the transmission . if we like , say that the energy source of the country is , you do n't just the technology , you must also with the risk around , the energy from where different from ?
and there is that <unk> .
and in the dimension to show , i 'm all kinds of batteries , that are made , looking at , the to cars , computers , mobile phones , <unk> , for everything . and that i did with the amount of electronic energy , which the world 's using , compared to . i found out that all the batteries , that we now producing , less than 10 minutes of <unk> store would be .
we need so here , a great big break , something that for a factor of 100 be better is , when the approaches tried to the time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not as easy .
that happens when you try , these <unk> sources of saying we 20 percent -- 30 percent of <unk> to bring .
if you to about 100 percent to sustain want , you an incredible <unk> .
now , where do we go , what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project '' ? how we come to target ?
what we need are many companies , the work at it . hundreds .
in each of these five which we need at least 100 people .
and thank you will say , that are crazy ! that 's good .
i think , here in the ted group 's many , and there has been involved .
bill it has many companies , one of the one called <unk> the great <unk> has .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of companies the great things do and interesting ways , and i try this to support .
nathan myhrvold and i pay for a company that , may surprise , the nuclear approach that tracked .
it 's some innovations in <unk> ; <unk> , fluid .
the evolution has in this industry in some time ago , so it 's no big surprise , that some good ideas around .
this <unk> means that you instead of a part of <unk> , the one percent , that <unk> , we decided , the 99 percent to burn , that <unk> .
this is quite a crazy idea .
but actually you had about how long been thinking , but you could never into machine , whether it would work , but since it modern supercomputers -- there , you this machine and see that : aye . with the right <unk> , it looks like out , it <unk> .
and because you that 99 percent burning , it 's <unk> very much better .
actually burning you the garbage , and you can actually the waste of today reactors operate as <unk> use .
instead , about the head to break , burn it 's easy . a great thing .
this highly enriched uranium is being incremental uses , a little bit like a candle .

that solve really the <unk> .
here 's a picture of their place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part , of today down is , <unk> so it 's <unk> uranium .
this <unk> the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you <unk> inexpensive and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of lifetime of the planet .
you know , there 's still many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts , that we need , to move forward to come .
well think we us what we our success measure should .
how to our testament to look like ?
now , we go up to the goal , that we do need and then we 're talking about the <unk> .
many talk from an 80 percent reduction , by 2050 .
it 's actually very important that we go into .
the rest of 20 percent are in poor countries be produced , and still , a little farming . hopefully will <unk> and cement until then clean his .
so , this 80 percent to reach , have to the developed world , including countries like china , their <unk> completely change .
the other note says , whether we the <unk> technology using , if they 're in all developed countries used is and we on the way they 're to the rest of getting to .
this is really important .
this is a shift : this <unk> .
if we from there go back , what should that by 2020 testament to look like ?
it was supposed to the two elements in them .
we should the <unk> and use in on the way to bring . and less we <unk> , the lower is the <unk> be and so that , the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things we companies that not completely to the big <unk> lead , just right , or in fact that matter less like the other , which the speed of innovation for these major breakthroughs itself .
these major breakthroughs we need to <unk> track and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
you have many great books to this topic .
that al gore book `` we have the choice . '' and david <unk> `` <unk> <unk> <unk> the hot pockets air . ''
they go it really through and create a framework , where this wide it can be , because we need to support of all sides .
it 's a lot , that comes together to .
this is a wish .
a very <unk> desire , we this technology make up .
if you me just a wish for the next 50 years would like , i could the president who choose , a <unk> , and that i love , i could this desire vote , of which is , <unk> <unk> without losing co2 being invented . this desire take me .
this has the biggest impact .
if we this desire does n't get , will of digging between the long term and short term now people are terribly be , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich countries . and almost all life of these two billion are very much worse be .
what we have so do ?
for which measures <unk> i ?
we need to us for more <unk> use .
if countries , in places like <unk> meeting , they should not only about carbon talk .
you should those <unk> go and they were shocked by the look at low funds , the for that cutting-edge approaches spent to .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> & trade something that a <unk> going to make .
we need to the message out .
we need to dialogue rational and entire lead and the things that from the government be done .
it 's an important desire , but i think we can him meet .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you . just to <unk> something better understand -- first , you can us an idea of magnitude of investment be ?
bill gates : in the simulation on a supercomputer to do , all great scientist to get what we 've done , we just some 10 million . and even if we our materials in a russian reactor tested have , to make sure that it into works is you only in the <unk> million .
the difficult is take this building the first <unk> , another billion to find , the <unk> and the place of actually the first of it builds .
once the one 's done , when he that 's like i promised , it 's all very clearly , because the economics , the <unk> is so different than at <unk> , how we know it .
in the right to understand : that means deep in the ground to build almost like a vertical pillar nuclear <unk> , this <unk> <unk> and then starting the process goes up and working to continue to the bottom ?
bg : right . now you have the reactor and new <unk> , so there 's many people and lots of what , the wrong can go . this thing where you it opens and do <unk> or <unk> . that 's not good .
but if you very cheap fuel is , you him for 60 years <unk> -- think of a column -- that they bury , without all <unk> .
and it 's sitting there and <unk> 60 years long and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor , of yourself a solution for the garbage is .
bg : yeah . now , what to the garbage is happening : you can him sitting now -- there are much less junk with this method -- then , and take it and put him in the next reactor and burn it on .
and begin , by we the garbage take , the already exists , the in these <unk> or <unk> at the reactor is . it 's our <unk> .
so this is that , which for these reactors operate a problem was , that what we in our fill and so that will <unk> dramatically reduce during this process .
but while you with different people that world of those possibilities 've talked ,
where is the biggest issue , so what really do ?
bg : so we 've now let 's not on a place determined and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear point '' in the name is wearing . there 's passion for and people of business were in russia , india , china -- i was here and have the energy minister who and talked about , like this to <unk> fit .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the way done .
this is a final one thing that was done .
this is a more crucial step forward , but it 's like a faster reactor and some countries have this built , which is why anyone , of a fast these job has , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , <unk> and about this is something really into life to shout out ?
bg : so we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that 're very affordable , we have 20 years , for reinventing and then 20 years to use .
that 's sort of the <unk> us , the <unk> this has , that we all need .
and , you know , <unk> , if anything good things , and this is a big desire , it could easily think .
and fortunately , you have today , dozens of companies , and we need hundreds , the , as well , when their approaches work , the funding for their pilot can work , for <unk> can .
and it would be at the best when it several create , because then you could a mixture use .
on any case , we need a solution .
about the great possible breakthroughs , this is the greatest , that you know ?
bg : a <unk> is that <unk> .
that it would be even without the <unk> been , but that makes it so much more important .
in the nuclear sector are there other innovative companies .
you know , we know the work not as well as this , but there 's the modular way , that 's a different approach .
it 's a <unk> <unk> , which bit difficult like , but may say that 's about us .
and so there are different , but the beauty in it is that a <unk> a million times as much energy , like a , we say , a <unk> and therefore , if you with the issues can deal and they are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in a own league .
if it does n't , what ?
we need to <unk> stem , to try , the <unk> robust to hold ?
bg : if you in this situation is , it 's as if you to a lot has eaten , and about to a heart attack is . what makes you then ? all you might be an <unk> or something .
it 's a <unk> the to <unk> called , and with various techniques 're dealing , in the warming to delay , so we 20 or 30 years longer just about us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope , that 's what we do n't need .
some people say , you should really not only on the insurance will work because one that might be lazy power , so you go eat , because you know that a the <unk> save it .
i do n't know , if this smart is if you have the importance of this problem of eyes is , but there are now a discourse in <unk> about whether you that to have the should , if the things faster come , or this innovation longer need , when we expect .
deniers like , you have a or two sentences for the in , you may have to convince ?
bg : well , unfortunately , life the skeptics in very different up for .
the ones that scientific arguments do , are very little .
they say , it negative impact is , the with the clouds to do have , the things shifting ?
it 's very , very few things that they actually can say , of which it a chance in a million there .
this <unk> here is similar as with aids .
you do the mistake now , and you pay for this very much later .
and it 's why is the idea , now , if you all kinds of <unk> have issues , in something to invest , of that you only later , what -- and to come , the investment not realize is . in fact is the ipcc report did n't necessarily the worst possibility is and there are people in the rich world , and climate and look say , okay , that 's no big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty 's take care to do .
but my dream here is that , if you it economic can do , and at the carbon over , they say that , the skeptics , `` okay , it interested me not that 's no carbon <unk> , i wish i almost , it 's doing , but i 'm going to it would accept , because it 's cheaper than the previous one way . ''
and that would be your answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that , if you all this time and energy use to the co2 problem to solve , all the other outcomes have suffered , the <unk> , the taking of malaria and so forth , that it 's a stupid waste of resources , is money for it to invest , as it better stuff there , that we can do .
bg : well , the actual volumes for research -- we say the u.s. to 10 billion per year , more spend when they do today -- that 's not so dramatically .
it should be other things not suffer .
you come then to big <unk> , and there can reasonable people <unk> , if you something has this , not economic is , and try this , to fund . for me is happening here the most of waste .
it 's because , you is really about to a <unk> and financed , just the learning curve . i think we should be more things are trying to the potential that have , very much cheaper to be .
if the <unk> , the you get , a very high <unk> is , then you can only the rich compete .
i mean , one of us here could five times as much for our energy spend on without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion but it 's a disaster .
and even <unk> think about .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research not more been talking about ? ''
he is still , because of its former stories , with the <unk> associated , but it has understood that 's a very rare group is and so it 's now that <unk> .
and that 's a line of thinking that i for them appropriately think is .
the research , it 's just nuts , how little the who will .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope , that her wish i think it . thank , thank you .
bg : thanks .
of years ago , here at ted , and peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' before .
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> have to the biggest possible <unk> structure with 20 eating spaghetti , about . meter tall tape , about . meter tall thread , and a marshmallow building .
the marshmallow have on top be .
and , though it really just seems , it 's actually really hard , it because people are pushing very quickly work together .
and so i thought , that this an interesting idea is and i did it into a <unk> into .
it was a huge success .
since i have about 70 workshops worldwide doing , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there 's something about this task , which deep experiences in the nature of cooperation are and i want some of them with them .
usually on the most people to itself in terms of task to orient .
they 're talking about , you think about how it will look like , they <unk> to do ,
and then they invest you a little time in planning and organization . you drawing out and put eating spaghetti out .
they invest a great deal of their time in the on-the-fly molecular assembly just always <unk> structures
and finally , just before they no time more have , take someone the marshmallow and they put him gently in the top , entering a step back and `` <unk> ! '' admire them their work .
what but then , almost always , happens is that the `` <unk> '' to a `` <unk> '' is , because the weight of <unk> does , the whole thing to be and <unk> .
it 's a series of people that much more `` <unk> '' <unk> have than others , and among the worst are totally fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they cheat , they are confused and make really <unk> shapes .
and obviously there is also team that much more `` <unk> '' <unk> , and among the best are totally fresh alumni of this kindergarten .
and this is quite astonishing .
like us peter told they 're not just the top towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask will is : how is that ? why ? what is with whom ?
and peter told , `` none of the kids spend time in head of eating spaghetti <unk> to be . ''
they invest no time in <unk> .
but it 's one more reason .
and it , that <unk> trained were , the one right plan to find , ok !
and it then to do .
then what happens when you the marshmallow on the top into , they have any time more and what happened ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what kindergarten kids do differently is that you with the marshmallow start and prototypes building , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on top , so that you numerous times the opportunity to have <unk> prototypes to fix .
certainly constructionists realize that kind of collaboration as a core of a <unk> way .
and with every attempt get the children are directly feedback what works and what do n't .
this is the performance with , prototypes to work , far -- but we see again , how other teams act .
the average for most strongly at about . <unk> , <unk> create the half of them , lawyers something more , but not much , kindergarten kids are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architect and engineers , to happiness .
meter tall is the ultimate , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they triangles understand and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build structures to build .
the ceos are something about average . but here it 's interesting .
when you put a <unk> an administrator at the team , they dramatically better .
it 's unbelievable . you see in order , and see `` this team will win . ''
you can the predictions . why does that ?
because they particular skills of <unk> have .
they pass the process , they understand it .
and that team that regulates and on the work paying attention is the performance of teams dramatically improve .
<unk> skills and <unk> and the combination lead to deal .
if you 10 teams have , the typical of approach , you get about . six , the robust structures have .
i tried so something exciting .
i thought , we bring the <unk> same .
so provided me a 10,000 pieces $ price of software for the winner .
what you think happened with these <unk> ?
what was it ?
this is what happened . not a team had build a structure .
if anyone cares about a <unk> of construction , would have , he had the price back for by .
so is not interesting that high <unk> a high effect have ?
we repeated this exercise with the students .
what you think happened now ?
well understood it the benefit of `` <unk> . ''
so , from the same , bad team of one of the best .
they produced the highest construction in the slightest time .
it 's so <unk> lessons for us , about nature of propulsion system and success .
you might say , why would somebody actually time on a <unk> to create ?
the reason is i <unk> digital tools and processes to create , in teams to help , cars , video games and `` <unk> <unk> '' to create .
and what the <unk> do is , it helps them hidden assumptions to identify .
because , frankly , , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or . <unk> , the right prototype stage to build .
and this is the value of this experience , so these simple practice .
and those of them , that it does , can <unk> visit .
it 's a blog , where you see , you the <unk> building .
it 's a <unk> there .
they find a crazy examples from all world as people the system optimize and <unk> .
it 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson i believe that is that 's construction actually a <unk> sports is .
it needs , we all our senses in the problem set up and , we our thinking can optimally use , like our feelings and we do , in the challenge , the before we have .
and sometimes is a small prototype this experience anything , what it takes us , by a `` <unk> '' -- to a `` <unk> '' moment to bring .
and that can see a huge difference do .
thank you .
we do such as if we have here a machine ,
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a machine .
and everybody in this room have in .
and they do in time go , you can in the future go ; they can not in here right , and remain ,
and i 'm thinking , what you vote would , because i my friends in last time often asked this question have , and they wanted everybody in time go .
i 'm not . they wanted in the time back , before it cars were or twitter or `` america for the american idol '' .
i 'm not .

and understand that i .
i 'm not part of this group , i must say .
i 'm not in the past , and that not because i a explorers am .
it 's because remember that are on planet not go back , you go ahead .
so i want in this machine , and i want in the future go .
this is the greatest the time it ever on planet there , whatever , what scale they do : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining <unk> .
we had ever been a time as these .
my <unk> were all when she turned 60 were .
my grandparents had urged the number to 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> .
there was so much a nine the beginning of my <unk> are .
but it 's not just to people like us , because this is a bigger than that .
a kid that today in new delhi there 's can expect , so long to live as the richest man in the world , 100 years .
you think about it . it 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox , billion people on planet killed .
they have the demographics of the world to some new shaped , how it 's no war ever managed to have .
they are out . they are gone .
we have you <unk> . phew .
in the rich world are diseases , the millions of us , just one generation , threatened have , hardly anything else .
<unk> , <unk> , polio --
donâ€™t even anybody else , what it is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability , billion people to feed , this is that successes of scientific method .
and in my view is the scientific method , test things out , look , if it works , it change , if it 's not doing , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately it 's been all the good news , because there 's a few other problems , and they were frequently said ,
and one of this is that despite all of our external rÃ©sumÃ© a billion people in the world every day hungry to go down .
this number drops , and she goes up very quickly , and that 's a .
and more than that , we have our imagination used to , this world we to totally trash your .
drinking water , <unk> country , rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , and it 's soon , and if we do n't from this chaos <unk> disappear , we .
the question is so , we can do that ? i think it is .
i think this is clear that we food can produce , the billion people feed them will , without the country , on the they live , to rape .
i think we can this world with energy power , that they do n't the destruction .
i think that really , and no , this is not <unk> .
but here keeps me at night up -- one of things that me at night up think . we have scientific way forward is ever so desperately need to like now , is ever ,
and we were also never even in the position , it into <unk> , such as we it today can .
we 're at the threshold to see , an events in many places . and yet , i think really , we hundreds , 300 years ago that i go back to have , in a time to find , in the we progress fighting have , in the we about these things <unk> <unk> have on , more got a now .
the people putting around , in their faith , and it 's so closely , you 're not that can .
n't even the truth is it starts .
and they stop , everybody has a right on his mind , even a right on his mind , for progress ,
but you know , what they were no right ?
they do n't quite on their own facts . <unk> , you do n't .
and i have a while it , to find out .
in about a decade , i have an article about vaccination for `` the new yorker '' written , a little paper .
and i was amazed , in opposition to bump , the resistance towards with what the end of the most effective activity in health in the human history is .
i did n't know , what i should do , so i did just what i always do , i wrote an article , and forth .
and soon on that i wrote an article about genetically engineered changed food .
the same thing , only bigger .
the people were playing out there .
so i also an article about writing , and i could n't understand why the people thought that would be `` <unk> , '' why they believed that molecules on a certain instead of a random kind <unk> a <unk> on the area of nature was .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we type , we join a , we go food , that 's okay .
but these articles made me worried , and i could n't figure out why , and finally , i found it out .
and that it 's because , these <unk> , the me nuts were actually does n't even <unk> were .
it 's been prudent people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and this led me that mess .
but then i thought , you know what , are we face .
we 're at a point where , in which we 're not the same proportion to the progress , how did .
we 're talking <unk> it .
we 're talking way of them , with little <unk> about , `` forward . ''
okay , for it 's reasons , and i think we know the reasons that are .
we have this faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science in the lost , and there 's no reason why that not like to be .
you can just a couple of names call and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can their own list vote .
it are questions and problems with people , of which we believed that they always right . so be skeptical .
imagine you ask , for you evidence , for you some evidence .
and take nothing as a given to there .
but now is it , when you evidence get you have this evidence think , and there are not good .
and i can it from the reason say that we now in an epidemic of fear life , i do you have never seen , and hope will never see again will .
in about 12 years ago was a story came out , a horrific story that the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in connection made .
very scary .
of studies have been done in order to see if it was true .
of studies should be conducted ; it 's a serious business .
the data came in .
the data came in looking out of the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all together , any correlation , no link , does n't even .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter , because we of anecdotes , is we believe what we see what we to see , is what does , we us really feel .
we do n't think about a bunch documents from a <unk> us , data is , and i understand that , i think that we do all .
but you know what ?
the result of it was devastating ,
devastating because of this fact , the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world , where the immunization rate by for <unk> down .
this is <unk> and we should be ashamed .
it 's terrible .
what happened , we do that could .
now , i understand that . that i do .
because has anybody here <unk> ?
has a single in the audience ever someone at <unk> die see ?
does n't very often .
happening in this country do n't actually , but to 160,000 time on the world last year .
that are many deaths from <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because that not happening here is , we can it crowd , and people like jenny mccarthy , around and messages of fear and illiteracy , platforms like oprah and larry king live preaching for .
and that you can do , because they cause and correlation not connecting .
they do n't understand , these things does n't seem to be , but almost never the same thing is .
and this is something that we have to learn , and it 's very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk has .
it liberated us from a tough neighborhood <unk> of humanity .
not afraid , no moons , polio , phew , gone .
the guy in the middle not so much .
he is paul <unk> .
he has just with some other people a <unk> up .
he can the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing save .
pretty well , not ?
so , that 's good , besides that , that paul <unk> and over vaccines talking and says , how valuable they are , and that people just quit ought to complain .
and that says he actually so .
paul is a terrorist .
if paul in a public <unk> talks , it can not without armed example statements .
he gets calls to home , because the people he 'd like to talk about that you know where his kids going to school .
and why ? because paul a <unk> did .
i do n't say that , but vaccines are eating essential .
you take it continues , let 's the disease go back , terrible disease and this going on .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon going to kids back to die , because it 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not just on <unk> die .
, what polio ? we take this . why not ?

they have that ever said earlier .
they would your kid not against polio bench . on no means .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't polio have . and you know what ?
we had in this country yesterday no polio .
now , i do n't know , maybe up now this morning someone in lagos , in a plane and fly right to los angeles start , in the moment he is about ohio .
and in a few hours ends up he and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's one of these <unk> <unk> today night coming .
and he does n't know him , with a <unk> disease there is , and we know that not too , because that 's how the world now time .
this is the planet , on the we live . they do n't so , as if he 's not .
we love it , us in lie to putting around . we love this .
you have today morning everybody their vitamins had taken ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that you of the hops helps .
i know that they did that have , because half of the americans that every day power .
you take this stuff , and you take an alternative cure , and it does n't matter , how often we find out , that they 're useless are .
the data will give the time .
they make their urine . do more you almost never .
that 's okay , they want to 70 billion dollars to dark urine numbers .
i agree with them completely to .
dark urine . dark .
why we do this ? why we do this ?
now , i think , i do -- we hate the industry .
we hate a to strong government . we have n't trust the system .
and that we should not too . our healthcare system is sucks .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> ourselves to us , the afford it can .
we go so that way , and you walk we ?
we walk in the poor of <unk> .
it 's fine . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious business , because this stuff is crap , and we just billion dollars for that .
and i 've all kinds of little through some here .
none of them -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , cheating , <unk> , there do i do n't time , what this is , but we give a billion dollars for it out , it 's cheating .
and you know what ? if i say , scream me the people , and say , `` what looks after it you ? let the people but do what you want .
so you feel a good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
it because i do is whether it the <unk> is saying , , `` hmm , i 'm going to the evidence of experts to mammography does n't take on '' or any <unk> , of his patients with <unk> treat want .
if you to on this path moving , where think and magic there and science replace , they at a place , in which they do n't want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he was 400,000 its people to , because it on it was , that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more effective than <unk> drugs are , of which we know that it the course of aids brakes can .
hundreds of thousands <unk> death in a country , the worse than any other of this illness who will .
tell me ask not that these things not a consequence have .
that you have . that they 've always .
now , the <unk> epidemic , in the we we face now , is this ridiculous struggle between the <unk> genetically engineered <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is this ideology , not science .
so everything we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , everybody <unk> , was from the people changed .
you know , there 's no <unk> in the garden .
there 's no <unk> .
there 's no <unk> . we have this all done .
we have it in the last eleven thousand years ago .
and some of them has worked and sometimes not .
we 're got rid of , what does n't have .
now we can it actually do . and obviously there is it risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice do , and this stuff can million people who help , million people , their lives to increase .
that you want to do n't do ?
i must say , understand that i do n't .
we refuse genetically engineered changed food off .
why we do that ?
now , what i always hear is , to a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we do n't want huge areas with one thing , that 's wrong .
we do n't that companies alive patent .
we do n't that companies seeds have .
and you know , what my answer to all this is ?
yes , they 're right . fix we that .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but it 's not science .
that has with science nothing to do .
it 's right , morality , <unk> .
you know that the science not a company is .
it 's no country .
it 's not just an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes work he and sometimes not , but the idea that we of science not allow should , your work to do , because we fear , is a real dead end , and they keep millions of people of blooming from .
you know , in the next 50 years we 're 70 percent longer growing food to as the moment . 70 percent .
that investment in africa in the last 30 years .
a . a .
they do that , and we give you this not .
and why ? genetically engineered changed food .
we want people do encourage , this <unk> stuff to eat , like for example <unk> .
<unk> is something that a half billion people eat .
it 's about how a potato .
it 's just a bunch calories . it 's sucks .
it does n't nutrients , it 's not a protein , and scientists building that all right at a .
and then you could the people are the food and would n't blind be .
you would n't starving , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would be nice .
and all what i say to that can is : why fight us that ?
i mean , we ask ourselves : why fight us that ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about , genetics <unk> . it 's not to chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our n't on more food , better food , act food .
it 's not about for visionary <unk> , it 's about , people in life to get , and it 's time again , to understand what this .
because you know what ?
if we n't do this , if we so on doing as far do we have a bit guilty , in which we , i believe , not guilty want to be , high-tech colonialism .
it 's no other description for that what happened here .
it 's become selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our not worthy , and we need to the really stop .
after this incredible funny entertained to so you might say , `` you still , in this ridiculous time machine and in the future go ? ''
in any case . that i want to every case .
now in them in this the presence , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can this machine on all imagine , what we want .
we can you <unk> , where we 're <unk> want , and we will you get there are moving , where we want .
we need to those conversations have , and we need to think , but if we 're in the time machine up and in the future go we 'll be happy to be , that made to have .
i know that we can , and far as it myself in this is something which the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time i 'm interested me for the <unk> . it may weird sound , that is a magician interested in that , it 's because , you look at it so i do , as `` a deception , the to something real is , when someone just find enough to believe . ''
with other words , <unk> have in some trials a measurable effect out , the <unk> , and it 's just so , because the person thinks , what do with it happens , is one <unk> or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , there is it when the patient just find enough to believe , a measurable effect in the body , you the <unk> calls .
a delusion is going to something real laughs , because someone it so perceive .
so we us each other also understanding , i want you a fundamental , very simple magic trick show .
and i 'll show you , as it works . this is a trick , the at least for the 1950s in every <unk> for kids standing .
i was him from <unk> scout magic of <unk> in the 1970s learned .
i 'm going to him for you do and it will explain .
and then i 'll explain why i it 'll explain .
so , you see , what happens .
that knife , that you look at this can ; my hand , that you look at this can .
i 'm going to that knife just so in my my think .
i <unk> my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears , or from him out , i 'll just my wrist right here <unk> .
on this way you can see that is to any time you move . long as i here <unk> , can not in my sleeve hiking , or may emerge .
and the goal of it 's very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is that knife by my bare physical magnetism be written .
it 's sitting in fact that are stuck in its place , that there i shake it , without that the knife <unk> .
nothing goes in my sleeve , or comes out , no <unk> . and they can all look at .
<unk> !
so , that 's a trick that i often young kids <unk> , and for magic interested , because you can you very much about deception learning , if you look <unk> , though it a very simple <unk> trick is .
probably know many of you in this room that trick .
he does this way .
i think is that knife in my hand .
i 'm saying that i my wrist <unk> , to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears , or out , and that 's a lie .
the reason why i my wrist <unk> , is the , that at the real secret of illusion is .
in the moment which is , where i my hand of you <unk> , so they 're from behind see , is moving this point here , my run , just from there , where it was , in a position , in the he this extended is .
wonderful trick ?
there back and somebody , of a childhood had .
so , he 's here today . right .
and when i 'm <unk> , changing the hands on its position .
and now you could talk about , why it a delusion is , why you 're not perceive , that down here just three fingers to see are , because the mind and the way , he 's information processing , they do individually counts , one , two , three , but it as a group can see .
but this is it now here really did n't . and then down i my hand .
of course , it there be written , but not by the magnetism my body , but by a trick , by my run , the right now there is .
and when i my hand 'll conclude , going on the same thing , by i 'm <unk> , going through the movement hidden behind , that the finger , again <unk> .
i take these hand away . and there is the knife .
this trick you can your friends and your neighbors just run . thanks .
now , which was that with the <unk> to do ?
year ago or so , i read a study that i really properly my world has .
i 'm a doctor or scientists , and therefore , it for me an amazing thing .
it has , which is what turned out , when you a <unk> in form a white pill to supply , in the form of a <unk> , it 's just a round , white pill , the a specific measurable effect , did .
but if you the form , in the you that <unk> to for instance , in a smaller pill change , and these blue color and one letter to <unk> , it is actually measurable more effective .
and that , though none of them any <unk> -- it 's just <unk> .
but a white pill 's not as well as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really freak out .
it turns , but out that it 's not it 's .
if you <unk> take , that are more effective than <unk> every form .
a colored capsule , the one of the yellow and at another red is , is better than a white capsule .
that , the <unk> plays a role .
a pill twice a day 's not as well as three pills -- i 'm now not on the exact me remind . do i 'm sorry .
this crucial but , is ...
... that that , the <unk> play a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you the ultimate <unk> have to , you have to the needle them .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> substance , you a patient into .
that creates a very powerful image in mind . that 's very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'm going to you you one another time show , if we a <unk> have .
fact , is that the white pill not so good looks like the blue pill , the not so good looks like a capsule , the not so good looks like the needle .
and none of that has some really <unk> property . it 's only our believe it , the in us a stronger . pursuing sabbaticals .
i wanted to know if i this idea for a magic trick could use .
i take something that obviously a delusion is , and let 's really look .
we know , from that trial , you to the needle has to grab , if it to the thing going to .
this is an 18 one long <unk> . it 's very , very <unk> . and i 'm going to you first a little bit <unk> .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not <unk> from hollywood .
i 'm now this needle in my skin sting and through them , push , to them on the other hand , forms .
if you 's going -- if they easily in <unk> fall -- i did that a few friends last night in the hotel room knows , and some people that i did n't know , and it 's a woman who almost <unk> become .
i 'm so ago , if you very bad will , then you look for the next 30 seconds away . right , you know what , i 'm going to the first <unk> part of back here do .
you can it to see , you can but also <unk> , if you want .
so , it 's so , right here , where my ham starts , on the bottom of my <unk> i 'll just a little <unk> do .
do i really sorry . it does it 's crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side that way back out .
now we 're actually in the same situation , that we the <unk> had .
about .
but now you can my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , i will they show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know , what people think , if you see that .
they say , `` okay , the 's probably not so stupid and <unk> to itself the skin , just to us a few minutes , to speak . ''
now , then i 'm going to show you .
how can see that from here ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and people back say , `` okay . i did n't that 's seen . ''
the people in the <unk> are now in .
let 's me give you from near the show .
this is really my skin . this is not <unk> from hollywood .
this my ham , and i can that <unk> .
do i 'm sorry . if you 's going , you look away , you look n't go .
the people back or the , the that later at once on video see , will say , `` well , this looks like i they 're impressive out , but if it really would be , he would -- you see , here 's a hole and there , if it really think it would be , it would bleed . ''
okay , let me a little bit of blood for you <unk> .
yes , this is it .
usually i would now the needle take .
i would my arm would take and you show that 's no which are .
but i think , in this on here and with the intention , from a deception something real to do , i 'm going the needle just in there 's and so from the stage go .
we 're going to us in the next days have some time look .
i hope you are already , it . thank you .
everybody talks about today , on happiness .
i have some people the number of books are now , with the `` <unk> '' in the headline in the last five years published , and they gave after about 40 up , and there was even more .
it 's a massive wave of interest in luck of explorers .
it 's very much <unk> .
everybody would like the people are happier do .
but despite all of tide of work , it 's a cognitive fall , that it sort of almost impossible make , clear about happiness thinking .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive map into action .
this is for <unk> , the about their own happiness think , and it 's for scientists , the of happiness think , because it turns out , we this is exactly what are like everyone else .
the first of falling is a <unk> , complexity own .
and it turns out that word that happiness just not a useful in word is more , because we it on to many different things work .
i think it 's a particular meaning , on that 's what we confine could , but in large and all this is something that we give up to be , and we 're going to the complicated view would have to this , what it 's .
the second case is a confuses of experience and mind : basically made them between be happy in his life and be happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the <unk> fact that we 're not about a situation that can think , of well-being impacts , without its importance to warp .
i mean this is a real cognitive trap .
it just no way , it right down to get .
now i 'd like with an example start by someone , that one <unk> had to one of my lectures , of a story told . [ unclear well , he said , he had a symphony heard , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and all the end of recording there was a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then put it to , really quite emotionally , that has the whole experience ever ruined .
but that had n't it .
what it ruined had been the memories of the experience .
he had the experience about .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
they <unk> not because it with a memory <unk> was ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all what he to keep getting had .
what we really that says is that we about ourselves and about other people think might in terms of two types of self .
it 's a <unk> itself , the present in live and the present know , is able , the past back to experience , but basically just the presence has .
it 's the <unk> itself , that the doctor <unk> -- you know when the doctor says , `` do now it hurts , if i you here <unk> ? ''
and then there is an <unk> itself , and that <unk> itself is that , that <unk> and the story of our lives up gets , and it 's one , that the doctor <unk> by he the question is , `` how did they 're in last time feel ? ''
or `` what was their journey to albania ? '' or whatever .
these are two very different entities , that <unk> ourselves and that <unk> itself , and both to confuse 's part of <unk> of <unk> from happiness .
so , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that starts really with a basic reaction to our memories of -- it begins immediately in .
we tell not just stories , if we set out doing , stories to tell .
our memory tells us stories , this is , what we of our experiences do n't get to is a story .
and you make <unk> with an example start .
it 's an old study .
that are real patients , and a painful procedure go .
i wo n't go into . you today is not more painful , but she was painful , as this study in the 1990s . did was .
they were asked , all of 60 seconds about their pain to report .
and there are two patients . it 's her records .
and they 're wondering , who by both have more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient b clearly has more suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient i 'd had patient b , and more .
but now there 's a different question : how much thought about these patients that you suffered none ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient as a lot <unk> <unk> at the <unk> had as a patient b .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very one of history is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this shows ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the , the worse is was the , where the pain of the end up at its been . it 's a bad history .
so how we know that ?
because we these people after their <unk> asked have , and too much later , `` how bad was the whole thing overall ? well ,
and she was much worse for a as to b in the <unk> .
so , that 's a direct conflict between the <unk> myself and the <unk> itself .
out of view <unk> even had b a clear <unk> time .
now , what you with about a could do , and we 've actually clinical done experiments , and it 's been done , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of patient a increase by just the hose in itâ€™s not too much about him to bit .
that 's going to that go the patient one has , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you that a few minutes , power , you did , that the <unk> themselves from about a worse off is and you have does , that the <unk> themselves from about a lot better off is , because now you patient as a better story about his experience been .
so opposed to a story from ?
and this is for the stories that the memory to provide and it 's also for the stories that we create .
to make a story <unk> are <unk> , great moments and end .
end are very , very important and in this case <unk> the end .
so , that <unk> even live his life grow .
it has moments of <unk> , one after another .
and they say , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're for all over .
i mean , most moments of life -- and i have that does -- you know , the psychological present is true than about three seconds long . which means , you know , it in a life about 600 million of that there . in a month it 's about 600,000 . the most of you leave no behind .
the most of you 're completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet you get kind of the sense that they are should , that what during these moments of <unk> going on our lives .
it 's the finite resource , that we use as we in the world are .
and how we they consume would seem to be important , but that 's not the story that this <unk> even for us to keep .
so that , we <unk> ourselves and that <unk> itself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the managing to time .
out of view <unk> even if you a vacation , and the second one week just as well is how the first , it 's the <unk> vacation twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
so does that do n't even for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation little better than the <unk> holidays , because there any new memories added to .
they have the story n't changed .
and on this way is time in the critical variable , the a <unk> itself is different from a <unk> itself . time has very little impact on this story .
so , that <unk> itself is more , as to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's actually any other , the decisions you could use , because if you a patient who have , the , we say two <unk> at two different surgeons had and to decide , which he choose to , it 's the , of how the , of the memory is , the less bad is and this is the surgeon , the selected will be .
this <unk> itself has no voice in that election .
actually do we choose not between experiences . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we in the future thinking , we think about our future n't usually when experiences .
we think about our future , as <unk> memories .
and actually can you that look , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> itself , and they can be the <unk> even thinking as one that sort of the <unk> itself <unk> through experience , the that <unk> themselves do n't need .
i have the sense that if we 're on doing this very often the case is , this is , we do on vacation largely the services of <unk> itself .
and that 's a bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much 'd rather live we of our memories ?
this is one of explanations , the for the dominance of <unk> even gave it .
and when i think about , think of a vacation that we in a few years of antarctica 've done , the clearly the best on was that i ever had had , and i think quite often about the relationship that , how often i of other <unk> think .
and i 've probably from my memory of these <unk> journey , i 'd say about 25 minutes , in the last four years <unk> .
now , when i ever the folder has opened have to the 600 images and i would have another one hour spent .
so , that are three weeks , and that are <unk> half hours .
because it seems a <unk> to give .
now , i like a little extremely be , you know , in it , how little appetite , i that 'd rather live of memories have , but even if you some more make it 's a real question . why are we memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight , that we experiences be ?
so i want , that you about a thought experiment thinking about .
and imagine your next on vacation ago , you know that the end of <unk> all their pictures being be and they get a <unk> drug , so that you to do n't remember to .
now , you would the same vacation vote ?
and if you a different vacation vote would , there 's a conflict between your two types of self and they have to think about you , this conflict to pick and this is really do n't actually , obviously , because if you in terms of time thinking they get an answer . and if you in terms of memories think you could one another answer to get .
why we the <unk> choose , that we enlist everyone 's a problem that to us out with a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of ourselves into two words from fortune on .
you actually two concepts of happiness , that we can use , one of a self .
so they can say , as happy that 's <unk> itself ?
and then they would say , as happy that are moments in life of <unk> itself ?
and they 're all -- lucky to have is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions , the measured can be ?
and , incidentally , we 're now been able a pretty good idea to get from fortune of <unk> ourselves over time .
if you after the luck of <unk> even asking it 's a very different thing .
this is not about how happy one person who lives .
it 's about how happy or gets the person is if this person about their lives think .
very different term .
everybody , of those terms n't which is the study of happiness up , and i belong to a lot of explorers of well-being , the the study of happiness long blew have on exactly that way .
the distinction between the luck of <unk> ourselves and the average happiness of <unk> itself is in the last years in people had been , and now , which you , and the two each to measure .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , the more than half a million people say they had been are about what you about their life thinking and about their experiences . and there was another efforts in the direction .
in the last years so we 've begun , on happiness of these kinds of self to learn .
and the largely lesson , that we believe that , i 've learned is that they really different .
you can know how happy somebody with his life is , and that teaches you really not much about how happy he his life living and vice versa .
just to you an idea of the downside correlation to convey , the downside correlation 's sort <unk> .
what that means is that if you who would meet and you would tell you , oh , his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about his greatness know ?
now , they would be something about his greatness know , but there are much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell them , that somebody his life than eight on a scale of 10 <unk> , you have much uncertainty about how happy he 's with his <unk> itself .
the downside correlation is so low .
we know something about what the average happiness of <unk> off .
we know that money very important is , goals are very important .
we know that happiness basically means , happy to be with people that we like , time to spend with people that we like .
it 's another pleasure , but it 's dominant .
so when the good of these kinds of self maximize want you will be the end very different things do .
the implication of with what i here 've said that is that we have been really not going to as an ample substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely another term .
now , very quickly , another reason , from that we 're not clear about happiness can think is that we 're not on the same things look if we about life thinking and if we actually life .
so when the simple question now , as happy the people in california are you will not the correct response time .
if you that question imagine if you think , that people in california happy to be if you , we say , in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you about life in california think , think of the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
now , and it turns out that climate not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful itself , that will decide , as happy people are .
but now , because the thoughtful itself is responsible , you can the end -- some people might the end to california are moving .
and it 's sort of interesting to track , what happens to people that to california are moving in the hope , happy to be .
now , you <unk> themselves will not happy to .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're going to think that you happier are , because if you think about you will it reminds be , how awful the weather in ohio was . and they will feel that there you the right decision met .
it 's hard , clear about well-being thinking , and i hope , i did you an idea of it gives , how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for them .
thank you .
now , when we in a few weeks phoning 've mentioned it to me , that it 's a pretty interesting thing was this , from this <unk> survey was .
this is this is something you to participate let can , because now a few minutes left have ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting thing , that we in the <unk> survey have found is a number , that we absolutely not to find expecting had .
we found that in terms on the good of <unk> itself .
if we look at how to emotions with the income <unk> .
and it turns out that , under an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a big representative sample , under an income of over 600,000 dollars a year
60,000 .
dk : around .
60,000 dollars a year people are n't happy , and they 're increasingly less happy , the poorer they 're going .
about that we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i 've ever so flat lines seen .
what happens is obvious that money a no <unk> releasing , but that lack of money one certainly misery releasing , and we can this misery very , very clear measure .
in terms of other self , of <unk> itself , you get a different story .
the more money you earned the work is you .
this is not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american an effort goes it about life , freedom , the pursuit for happiness .
when people that our database take seriously would , i mean , it looks like everything on its head to imagine , all what we think for instance , in relation to tax policy and so forth .
there 's a chance , that politicians , that the country in a finding like the take seriously would and based on that policy would make ?
dk : you know , i think that it recognition is for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition is going to be in the united states , no question , but the u.k happens you just and in other countries on you just .
the people are here , acknowledge , on that happiness think should , if you about politics thinking .
it 's a while , you and people will discuss , if you <unk> explore want or whether they <unk> explore want , so we have this debate pretty soon bring .
how you 're lucky because it 's very differently depending on about how you think and if they 're at the <unk> even think or whether you to the <unk> even think .
this is politics are shaping , i think , in the next years .
in the united states <unk> you , at this , <unk> the population to measure .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistic be .
now , it seems to me , this topic is , or should at the most interesting political debate to pursue be about the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .

i <unk> now for 10 years online game . and my aim for the next decade is , it as easy to make the world , in reality to save you , in <unk> to save is .
i have a plan for it . i want more people to convince , including you all , more time with the play more and <unk> games to spend .
now we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` this is a lot of this time for games . ''
maybe something to kind of time , when you think how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve have .
but in fact , my research on the institute for the future that , is exactly the opposite <unk> .
three billion hours per week are not nearly enough to the most problems of the world to solve .
actually i am convinced that , if we the next century on planet survival to , we this time dramatically increase to .
i 've figured out , the need time to , 21 billion hours <unk> per week it .
it appears first maybe something <unk> , so again i it , so it affect ca : if we issues like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity want to solve , i believe , we 're trying to play online for at least 21 billion hours per week until the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture is quite sure why i think that games like this critical for survival of human species in the future are . seriously .
this is a the picture of photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings and play catch . so he was the players a camera up .
this is one of the classic of the play .
if you 're not a player is , miss you may be some of nuances in this image .
you 'll probably this sense of urgency , a little freaked , but also <unk> concentration , very deepening in the problems of a really tough problem .
if you also play , you see some of nuances here , to the top <unk> eyes and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the brow show surprise .
this is a player , at the edge of a so-called <unk> <unk> says .
oh , you know that . ok. neat . so we have some player here .
a <unk> victory is a result , this is extremely positive is that they were n't really knew that about it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , you 're shocked , they actually to something that are capable . this is a <unk> victory .
this player 's about to a <unk> victory .

well , unfortunately , we look like this face in real life , if we challenging issues facing .
i call it as the `` in life i 'm bad '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that i am , i do that `` in life i 'm bad '' <unk> do .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california where i in my ph.d. studying why we 're in games are better than in real life .
this is an issue that a lot of gamers have .
we think that we in reality not that are good as in games .
and i do n't just less successful , although it to ours .
we reach in <unk> more . i mean well in relation to the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired to work together .
if we 're in a <unk> are , i believe , many of us , in our best version into , anytime and immediately <unk> are , intractable the problem to solve try , so long as it , it after the failure a second shot .
and in reality , if we fail , if we 're on those obstacles are hitting , feel we often different .
we feel ourselves overwhelmed . we feel that we have defeated . we feel ourselves threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated -- or <unk> .
those are n't have , if we play games , in play it 's just they do n't .

why is it in games are impossible to think , you could n't just all do ?
how we can feel this from the play in the reality right now ?
so i looked at me games like world of warcraft , at this , the ideal environment to collaborative problem solving is .
and i have some things started noticing , the epic victories by in <unk> so you can do .
so , first , if you in one of these online game going , especially in world of warcraft , there 's a lot of characters , that are willing , you a <unk> mission <unk> , and it immediately .
but not just some mission , but a mission , the perfect to her current level in the game is , right .
so they make it .
they have never a task , that you ca n't solve .
but always the edge of their skills , so you have a better . but there 's no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you is not around and turns <unk> . it 's always very specifically something important to .
and there are of staff .
now where they also go , hundreds of thousands of people that with them together , in their epic mission pitching .
that we have in real life not just like , this sense that at a <unk> of employees to stand .
what 's this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we have to do .
then what we this whole positive feedback .
they have strictly from `` level up '' and `` <unk> strength '' or heard `` <unk> intelligence . ''
that constant feedback not there in real life .
if i this stage leaving , i did n't , <unk> talk and <unk> crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i get in real life that feedback not .
so , the problem of <unk> how world of warcraft is that it so gratifying is , anytime on the edge of a <unk> <unk> to stand , we prefer our whole time in these <unk> spend .
you 're just better than the reality .
until now have all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years trying to , the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
this is not necessarily something bad .
it might sound bad .
but it in time in context to see , in <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> up to go .
the first <unk> primate and so .
ok , so if we talk about , how much time we now with play spend , it does just make sense , when you have the time in terms on the magnitude of human development of eyes are holding , what the most is .
but also be . because it turns out , we , by we all of this time to play using , in fact that change , what we as people in the are able to .
we create us to each now , very nature .
this is the truth . what i believe .
look at once you this thing about statistics , the more recently from a researcher of the carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man of today in a country with strong <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st . age .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number , from two reasons .
first time , for children in america are <unk> hours the exact <unk> , that you in school spend , of the fifth grade . until finally , the high school -- if you never missing .
so we here a complete <unk> , on the young people just learn what it means , a good players to be as anything else , which it in school learn .
and may have some of them the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> , '' read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great science of <unk> , that if we 10,000 hours with the <unk> from one of any subject to the 21st . age spend , we 're going to coming in it .
we are so good at , which also the to do , like the most people the world .
so , so what we have is a whole generation young people that <unk> are .
the big question is so , `` what exactly are player <unk> good ? ''
because if we that figure might , if we have sort of time ever since <unk> human potential available to .
so many people , we currently in the world that at least one hour a day with <unk> spend .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people that exceptionally good in `` something . ''
and the next decade we have another one billion player , the exceptionally good in which also the are .
if you it 's not have heard ,
the <unk> developed <unk> , the energy save and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so player on the world , especially in india , china , brazil online play .
you 're expecting an extra billion player in the next decade .
so we 've all of 1.5 billion player .
so i started , to think , what it is , what 's take these games to master do .
here are the four things that i found . first , <unk> .
ok , and imagine that as extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is that urge , right away doing things , a barrier to master , together with the believe that we a <unk> hope to success did .
i think always remember that a <unk> victory is possible , and that it always off , it to try , and it 's the same .
i do not sit around .
players are masters in spiders poet of social networks .
it 's a lot more interesting research , the show , that we are more like , after we with you have played , even if it 's bad defeated have .
the reason is , that a lot of trust is , with somebody a game to play .
we trust to this , that somebody time with us to spend , the rules <unk> be , we the same goal , and to the <unk> to stay .
so allow this <unk> that grow of ties , trust and each other .
as a consequence of building we stronger social relations in .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week is , sort of as <unk> .
the reason is that , if we play , we 're actually happier and , hard to work , as if we to relax , or doing nothing .
we know that we as human beings can optimally work , if we 're stiff , actually work done .
and players are always ready , hard to work , if you the real problem here .
and ultimately , epic meaning .
players love it , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> features to be .
here a <unk> , and the right light to back . you know definitely all of wikipedia , the largest <unk> the world .
the second largest <unk> the world , with nearly 80,000 entries that 's the world of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about world of warcraft on the <unk> than about some other issue in each other <unk> the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so that four superpowers , the to a single thing lead . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it 's the people who believe that you as a single change the world can .
and the only problem is that they believe , you can the virtual worlds change , but not the real .
this is this issue that i to solve really try .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is genius . he looked at , why people as much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 're going to witness of not less than one <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . ''
and that from an economist . so he is logical .
and he goes ...
not like i -- i <unk> games , i 'm a <unk> .
so he says , that makes actually make sense , because player can in <unk> achieve more than in real life .
you can in games are stronger social ties with each as in real life . you get more feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says , it 's currently entirely obvious , that players more time in the virtual world as in the real spend .
i voice first time to , it makes sense .
but it 's definitely no <unk> .
we need to start , the real world in a game to turn into .
my inspiration comes from an event , the use 2,500 years <unk> .
it are those ancient scripts cube , from <unk> . you know ?
in front of these fantastic <unk> there 's <unk> .
and that were sort of the first of people were <unk> .
and if you with the work of the ancient greek <unk> <unk> 're familiar , you know it might this story . the story about how and why games they were .
according <unk> were playing , specifically <unk> , in the kingdom <unk> during a famine invented .
we think there 's such a great famine , that the king of <unk> , to a crazy idea decided .
the people who suffered none . the people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according <unk> , that <unk> and agreed a national strategy . in one day would you eat . the day you would play .
and they would be as much in the <unk> deepening be , there 'll play so fascinating and are ourselves with <unk> , <unk> productivity by , they forget would , that it 's nothing to eat there .
and then , the day you would play . and the day would you eat .
and according to <unk> sitting right way you for 18 years that famine , by them in one day were eating and the next played .
as well , i think , put what we 'll play a .
we put play a , in the suffering from the real world to escape .
we put play a in , especially to avoid , that in the real world n't work , everything that in real life does n't gratifying is , and we bring us what we need from the play .
but that does not the end be .
this is the top .
according <unk> was to 18 years the famine not better . so decided to the king , one last <unk> piece .
they did this kingdom in two halves .
they played a <unk> and the winner got to a <unk> exploring it .
they were <unk> and made up on the to look for a new home . they were just so many people back , how it 's food to survive there and went to the rest for a place that in the they are able to .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> show that the <unk> , the later that <unk> wealth created , the same dna as the old <unk> have .
so came scientists recently to the notion , that <unk> ' crazy story actually true .
and geologists thought evidence of a global cooling , the almost 20 years before , what the famine to be .
so could this crazy story voices .
you may actually their people through play rescued , by it and for 18 years in games <unk> , and then this <unk> had and so much about the one another play learned , she makes the whole civilization saved have .
so , that we can also .
we play since 1994 warcraft .
it was the first <unk> in real time the world of <unk> . this was 16 years before .
they played for 18 years <unk> , we play for 16 years warcraft .
i do , we 're ready for our own his epic game .
now , you have half the your civilization in the search for a new world . so i take my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should it aarhus , the half of us an hour a day with play spend , until we the problems of the real world have solved .
i know , you 'll ask , `` how do we problems of the real world in play ? '' and in this question have my work in the last years ago at the institute for the future to .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it down on out how we the future understand better .
we do n't try , the future before to say .
what we want , is the future to make .
we want to the best results of unbelievable . and then people do <unk> , this idea in the reality to .
we put us epic victories by , and give people the ways that you to do .
i 'll show you very quickly three games that i 've designed , to try , people epic victories by in their own future to give .
this is `` world without oil . ''
this game is of 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , where you a <unk> get to .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it for you realistic it and they her real life in fact , without oil life . so , if you to to play <unk> , they tell us , where you live . and then get them <unk> in real time , the show you , how much oil costs , what it 's not there , as food at risk is how , at risk is , whether school closed are , whether it insurgency is there . and they 've got out how they her real life make , if it 's true would be . and we ask them , blog about , videos or shot photographs work .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 tested . and we have you 've been about the last three years with .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
nobody wants to be life change , because it 's good for the environment is or because we it should .
but if you in a <unk> adventures are and i get , `` let 's the oil . ''
this is a fascinating adventure , on that you about .
you find out how they survive would . the most of gamers have the the game <unk> habits be .
so we us for the next <unk> play a bigger , levels of the end into than just <unk> .
we have the game `` <unk> '' at the institute for the future up .
starting point is that calculation of a <unk> , that people just have 23 years on planet we have .
of supercomputers -- called `` global <unk> <unk> , '' of course .
the call to players , to sign , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> formatted .
you know jerry <unk> , where it 's `` <unk> '' there . you have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and just together they can save the world .
but in your game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in the <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to make .
8,000 i played the game at eight weeks for .
they were 500 incredibly creative solutions , that you read can , if you `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game we bring at 3 . march out . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you the game is , get them from the world bank the distinction `` social <unk> , '' graduating from 2010 .
we 're working with universities in all of sub-saharan africa and they invite one , social <unk> to learn .
we have a comic it . we have `` level up '' for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want them all invited , this game with young people to share , around the world , especially in <unk> , the of profit , to meet their own social enterprises to imagine , in the world to save .
i 'm now the end .
i want you some questions .
what , you think , happens next ?
we 've all those fantastic player , we have games that we show what we can do , but we have the real world 's not saving .
well , i hope that they me at agree that players are human resources are , that we to work in real life can use , and that play a great significance to change have .
we 've all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability , strong social networks to do , <unk> and that urge to <unk> meaning .
i really hope , we together , actually play games , in on planet one another century to survive .
and i hope you 're going to me that sort of play design and play .
if i into the next decade <unk> , i 'm me at two things sure , that we each <unk> future can create , and that we all kinds of play games can .
so i say , let the <unk> games start !
thanks .
i would you 'd like something to talk about what i was a few months at writing one article for <unk> wired noticed is .
i have to write and my <unk> <unk> , but i was with the processed of <unk> already ready , and to me , i never even in my life <unk> have , what the word `` getting '' really means .
i read them the post on .


i have this list a friend according to and had once you laugh , it seemed like this ridiculous , but i was just to `` ravaged '' and could n't more <unk> , and had to stop reading and i first capture for this <unk> <unk> and the so <unk> emotional shock .
obviously this was a <unk> , an old <unk> . i 've got me just thought that the issue , very old must be .
but actually it was a copy in the early 1980s , when i just with the elementary started and so began , my does outside of my family competition to build and to form , even in relation to other children and to the world around me around .
and thank god , i was no <unk> used .
i would this post take seriously if i was in a world born , that someone like me as a person of dignity , whose lives in <unk> in a positive go can . today , but i 'm going to the opportunity and adventure , i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i me , the <unk> of 2009 help and expect , here to a <unk> can find .
there 's the <unk> version of that <unk> .
unfortunately it is n't much better .
especially to shake me the last two words , `` <unk> <unk> '' `` now , '' and `` well . ''
but it 's not just about the words .
it 's about , what we about the people think , that we with these words which describe .
it is the values , the in these words stuck , and how we these values construct .
our language affects our thinking and how we the world and people to see around us .
many <unk> societies , including the the greek and the <unk> , really have believed , the <unk> of a <unk> a great force has , because that what you to <unk> , and also <unk> can .
so what we want to actually <unk> -- a <unk> people or a powerful people ?
just been a human <unk> as a child to call , could be enough , they limit , and you have performances <unk> .
it would not nice , you doors to open up ?
a person , the for me doors has opened up , was my pediatrician in the <unk> . <unk> institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he is dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , and as you think can , most americans are not accurate remain unspoken could . so he was always dr. p. called .
and dr. p. was always very colorful fly and was for work with kids just like created .
i found that the time i in this hospital 've spent , just great -- up on my <unk> .
i had one practice like an often are with these fat , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know , in my <unk> you . and i got that cut more . than anything . i did they hated . i have it bleeding . i did they hated .
and now , ago , i was actually , as <unk> child with dr. p. negotiate and so trying to , these exercise to stop , <unk> no success .
and one day he 's me at one of my exercises at -- these exercise was just tiring and up mercilessly -- and he told me , `` wow , aimee mullins , you 're like a lot , incredibly powerful tool and young girl , you will one day one of cut you .
and if you it can make , i 'm going to a hundred dollars . ''
this was obviously just a simpler one of dr. p. , so i the exercises do , the n't i wanted to do , with the prospect that richest little girl in the ward in the second stick to be . but it , i was actually get started doing , my daily <unk> with new way to see . so , it 's a new and <unk> experience .
and i ask me today , how much his vision of me as strong and incredibly powerful tool young girl my does shaped , and i 'm so imagine could , me as one of nature of strong , powerful and <unk> person in .
this is just an example of many , as adults in <unk> the imagination a child 's work can .
but how the already saying examples from the <unk> prove that lets us our language no room , and something to imagine , what we all want one would : it every single to make themselves , as powerful people in .
our language <unk> the societal change afterwards , the in many cases , by a technology changes really were .
by the medical point out at you can of course , say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titanium and artificial <unk> for aging body , that it allow people , really all their opportunities to use and you about the borders , that you your natural what happens to set has , out to develop , did n't speak to of social <unk> platforms , to people , a own identity give , and on its own way of define , and , it 's about to groups themselves , that it yourself choose .
maybe up so this technological change more powerful because ever , it always been a different truth gave , which is that every man of society , a completely <unk> and very incredibly powerful tool can give and that human ability , to adapt , our biggest plus is .


but the truth is that we change us . of course we are of the challenge of coined , no matter whether you physically , emotionally , or even two is
and i do , that this is good .



sometimes note i that he very your mind is , sometimes it 's not to see , but it 's always with me .
and i want to any sort the impact , or . the heavy of <unk> of people down .

so we 're not just responsible for , the people that we love , in <unk> to maintain , they also to prepare , well it clear to come .
and we provide our kids do n't know , if we give you feel that giving , that they 're not to adapt to do .
you have two things you separate , for a the medical fact , an amputation to be and the other the social i think about whether i disabled , or not .
and in order to be honest , the only real and have an disability , with the i 'm just sit down to , is that the world are constantly up , they could me with these definitions describe .
in our desire , the people to protect us , at the heart of and you the cold , hard truth about their medical prediction to or even a prediction for quality to imagine , that they expected , we need care , that we 're not the foundation for this time , that somebody actually getting is .
it may current concept that just for paying attention , which in a broken is , and how we that fixed , for every single one more disability than the pathology labs at it .

we <unk> a human , the for our society a value , did .
so we have about the <unk> beyond watching and us on every area of human possibilities focus .
at the most important but is that it between the perception of our shortcomings and our magnificent <unk> , a connection there .



in this year , celebrate we the 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he was 150 years of evolution has written , did darwin , in my eyes , on something very true in the human nature out .
i would it so what , not the most powerful its kind of time , and also not the <unk> its way , but the , the to change the best to be .
of conflicts of creativity .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the ability of people , to survive and <unk> , by the struggle of human mind is is , and by conflict to into .
so , again , change and things are the greatest kind of people .
and maybe we do n't , from the timber we <unk> are , if we really not-quite-right to .

we can us so even something to .



i think , the biggest damage that we ourselves to it have is to believe that we 're normal to be .
let 's true -- who is normal ?
it 's not a normal .
it 's the usual . this typical . but not the normal . and they would those poor , gray person 's really know learn to , if you really there ?
i think , more likely to do n't .
it would love , if we this paradigm of normality versus another the opportunity or the strength , and it even still a little bit dangerous to proposing , exchange can . so we can the forces of very many kids putting , and get you invite men , their very special and valued skills in the society itself .
<unk> have out found , we humans from the members of our society and one claimed by have , useful to be and a contribution to do .
it 's cues to this , that have the <unk> , 60,000 years older people and people with severe physical injuries to be driven by , and this was perhaps , because the life experience in the struggle for survival of these people for society value was ,
they have these people as broken and useless at ; they were as something special and valuable treated .
in a few years i went into the city , in the i grew up was , in a <unk> in those `` red zone '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there in a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> in .
and i hear , as a guy behind me say , `` well if it 's not aimee mullins <unk> is . ''
and i turn to me and see this for an man . i had no idea who he 's .
and i was like `` sorry , sir , we know us ? i 'm not to you remember . ''
and he said , `` well , you probably is hardly at me remind .
when i , they first saw , i did you from the belly of her mother got . ''
oh , so the .
and of course , it , but click done .
this was dr. <unk> , a man that i just like narratives of my mother about this day knew that i of course , very typical , to my birthday two weeks late to come .
the doctor for <unk> <unk> my mother was in the holidays , and so knew my parents of the man , of me to the world was , at all .
and because i without <unk> was born , and my feet , after them pointing had and i just a few toes , at this and a few toes in the other foot had it was the <unk> , these strangers to the bad news <unk> .
he said to me , `` i had to your parents say that you never going would , and never been such mobile be would like other children or that you never an independent life , could , and since then you have me simply lying <unk> . ''
really exceptional , i found him , <unk> my entire childhood now has , care whether i at a <unk> in the second grade 'd won , if i with the <unk> at the <unk> to <unk> coming which was , care whether i my fellowship , or one of my <unk> victories by <unk> had , and he was using these clips , in his students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x factor , the potential of human willing .
you can just not enough just like , critical of these factor for the quality of people can be .
and dr. <unk> ran on , he said , `` i 've learned that children , if you do n't always something other words get , and even if you just little support get , if you kids , even leaves energy , then you can children very much do . ''
you see , dr. <unk> has to think about changing .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and as someone with just , two different things are .
and i got my thinking in the time changed , if you me in the age of 15 years 'd asked , if i mean prostheses to legs of meat and bone switched have , then i would have a second <unk> .
i wanted was necessarily have normal work .
if you me that today , `` am i 'm not quite sure .
and that 's happening , because i something with my legs 've experienced and not in spite of these experiences .
and perhaps could this change also happen , because i so many human face 'm me , door opened have , instead of people to face , that i cut or me an idea on wanted .
you see , you need really just a human , of them for you , their forces <unk> can , and they 're in .
if it to people place , his own , inner power to activate , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do that , and for someone in a critical moment a door up , then they 're for those people a very good teachers .
they bring them on themselves , doors to open .
the real importance of the word `` <unk> '' rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means , something on , that in one is that 's potential <unk> .
again , which potential we would because now go in there ?
in the 1960s years ago was in britain a <unk> done . then were <unk> in <unk> tranformed .
they call that there `` <unk> <unk> '' in the u.s. what we call this as `` <unk> . ''
the students are going to grades . .
and the a student will <unk> harder not-quite-right , get the better teacher etc .
they have then over a <unk> period students with a `` enough '' the note , very good '' there . it was told them , they were <unk> , that you very clever would be . and after these three months , they really <unk> you .
and of course <unk> it a the heart to hear that in reverse the <unk> was told , they were just have enough .
and much it was then after the three months , too .
but only ones , the still , in school were -- apart from the students , the the school at had .
very crucial in this trial was that the teacher not <unk> were .
the teachers n't know , that something changed was .
you was just told that are the student and that are the students with the kind enough . and as you have you some trained and they 're treated .
the only real disability is a <unk> mind a spirit , the broken was , n't have a hopeless . he find nothing more beautiful . it 's our natural , one curiosity . and our an inherent capacity of the minotaur .
if we it but do , the human spirit of it to support , continue to hope for themselves , and other people to around it nice to find , inquisitive and <unk> to be then we rely our power really positive a .
when a spirit of those qualities have , we can be a new reality , new <unk> make .
i want to a poem end , that by a persian poet named <unk> in 14 century . it written , and of the me my friend jacques <unk> told you have . and the poem called `` the god , the only four words it . '' `` every child knows , god , not the god the name , not the god of <unk> , but the god , the only four words know , and these are constantly repeatedly , he says , only : come on , dance with me . ''
come , dance with me . thank you .
